SeqKit -- a cross-platform and ultrafast toolkit for FASTA/Q file manipulation

Version: 2.13.0

Author: Wei Shen <shenwei356@gmail.com>

Source code: https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit
Please cite: https://doi.org/10.1002/imt2.191


Seqkit utilizes the pgzip (https://github.com/klauspost/pgzip) package to
read and write gzip file, and the outputted gzip file would be slighty
larger than files generated by GNU gzip.

Seqkit writes gzip files very fast, much faster than the multi-threaded pigz,
therefore there's no need to pipe the result to gzip/pigz.

Seqkit also supports reading and writing xz (.xz) and zstd (.zst) formats since v2.2.0.
Bzip2 format is supported since v2.4.0.

Compression level:
  format   range   default  comment
  gzip     1-9     5        https://github.com/klauspost/pgzip sets 5 as the default value.
  xz       NA      NA       https://github.com/ulikunitz/xz does not support.
  zstd     1-4     2        roughly equals to zstd 1, 3, 7, 11, respectively.
  bzip     1-9     6        https://github.com/dsnet/compress
