DESCRIPTION
   Application to create BLAST database aliases, version 2.17.0+
   
   This application has three modes of operation:
   
   1) GI file conversion:
      Converts a text file containing GIs (one per line) to a more efficient
      binary format. This can be provided as an argument to the -gilist option
      of the BLAST search command line binaries or to the -gilist option of
      this program to create an alias file for a BLAST database (see below).
   
   2) Alias file creation (restricting with GI List or Sequence ID List):
      Creates an alias for a BLAST database and a GI or ID list which
      restricts this database. This is useful if one often searches a subset
      of a database (e.g., based on organism or a curated list). The alias
      file makes the search appear as if one were searching a regular BLAST
      database rather than the subset of one.
   
   3) Alias file creation (aggregating BLAST databases):
      Creates an alias for multiple BLAST databases. All databases must be of
      the same molecule type (no validation is done). The relevant options are
      -dblist and -num_volumes.
