 -- VCF/BCF analysis
    call         SNP/indel calling
    consensus    create consensus sequence by applying VCF variants
    cnv          HMM CNV calling
    csq          call variation consequences
    filter       filter VCF/BCF files using fixed thresholds
    gtcheck      check sample concordance, detect sample swaps and contamination
    mpileup      multi-way pileup producing genotype likelihoods
    polysomy     detect number of chromosomal copies
    roh          identify runs of autozygosity (HMM)
    stats        produce VCF/BCF stats

 -- Plugins (collection of programs for calling, file manipulation & analysis)
    41 plugins available, run "bcftools plugin -lv" to see a complete list

 Most commands accept VCF, bgzipped VCF, and BCF with the file type detected
 automatically even when streaming from a pipe. Indexed VCF and BCF will work
 in all situations. Un-indexed VCF and BCF and streams will work in most but
 not all situations.
