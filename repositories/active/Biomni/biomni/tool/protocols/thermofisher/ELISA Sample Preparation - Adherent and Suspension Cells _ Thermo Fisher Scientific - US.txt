OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Proper sample preparation is critical for successful ELISA experiments. This protocol describes methods for preparing samples from adherent and suspension cell cultures in a 96-well format. The prepared samples can be used directly in ELISA assays or stored for later analysis.

MATERIALS REQUIRED
================================================================================

• Cells in culture (adherent or suspension)
• Cell culture medium
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), ice-cold
• Cell lysis buffer (e.g., RIPA buffer, NP-40 lysis buffer, or commercial cell lysis buffer)
• Protease inhibitors (optional but recommended)
• Phosphatase inhibitors (if analyzing phosphoproteins)
• 96-well cell culture plate
• Cell scraper (for adherent cells)
• Centrifuge and microcentrifuge tubes
• BCA or other protein quantification assay kit

PROTOCOL
================================================================================

For adherent cells

1. Seed cells in a 96-well plate and culture until they reach the desired confluency or treatment endpoint.

2. Remove cell culture medium and wash cells once with ice-cold PBS.

3. Remove PBS completely.

4. Add 50-100 µL of ice-cold cell lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (and phosphatase inhibitors if needed) to each well.

5. Incubate on ice for 10-30 minutes with gentle shaking or rocking.

6. Scrape cells from the bottom of wells using a cell scraper or pipette tip.

7. Transfer lysate to microcentrifuge tubes.

8. Centrifuge at 10,000-14,000 x g for 10-15 minutes at 4°C to pellet cell debris.

9. Transfer supernatant (containing soluble proteins) to new tubes.

10. Quantify protein concentration using BCA assay or similar method.

11. Dilute samples to appropriate concentration in sample diluent (typically PBS or assay buffer) for ELISA.

12. Store samples at -80°C if not using immediately.

For suspension cells

1. Culture cells in appropriate vessel until they reach desired density or treatment endpoint.

2. Transfer cell suspension to centrifuge tubes.

3. Centrifuge at 300-500 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C to pellet cells.

4. Remove supernatant and wash cell pellet once with ice-cold PBS.

5. Centrifuge again and remove PBS completely.

6. Resuspend cell pellet in ice-cold cell lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (and phosphatase inhibitors if needed).

7. Use 50-100 µL lysis buffer per 10⁶ cells, or adjust volume based on cell density.

8. Incubate on ice for 10-30 minutes with occasional vortexing or pipetting.

9. Centrifuge at 10,000-14,000 x g for 10-15 minutes at 4°C to pellet cell debris.

10. Transfer supernatant (containing soluble proteins) to new tubes.

11. Quantify protein concentration using BCA assay or similar method.

12. Dilute samples to appropriate concentration in sample diluent for ELISA.

13. Store samples at -80°C if not using immediately.

For cell culture supernatant

1. Culture cells in 96-well plate until treatment endpoint.

2. Collect cell culture supernatant without disturbing cells.

3. Centrifuge supernatant at 300-500 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C to remove any cells or debris.

4. Transfer clarified supernatant to new tubes.

5. Use supernatant directly in ELISA or store at -80°C.

6. Note: Supernatant samples typically do not require lysis buffer, as secreted proteins are already in solution.

PROTOCOL TIPS
================================================================================

• Always work on ice to minimize protein degradation
• Include protease inhibitors in lysis buffer to prevent protein degradation
• For phosphoprotein analysis, include phosphatase inhibitors
• Optimize lysis buffer volume based on cell number and protein concentration
• Avoid excessive pipetting or vortexing, which can cause protein denaturation
• Keep samples cold throughout the preparation process
• Aliquot samples to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles
• Include appropriate controls (untreated cells, positive controls if available)
