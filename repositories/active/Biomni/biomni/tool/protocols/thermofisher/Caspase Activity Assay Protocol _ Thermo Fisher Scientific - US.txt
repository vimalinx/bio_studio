================================================================================

OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that play essential roles in apoptosis (programmed cell death). Measuring caspase activity is a common method for detecting and quantifying apoptosis. This protocol describes methods for detecting caspase activity using fluorescent substrates in both live and fixed cells.

APPLICATIONS
================================================================================

This protocol can be used for:
• Detecting apoptosis in cell cultures
• Quantifying caspase-3/7, caspase-8, or caspase-9 activity
• Screening for apoptosis-inducing compounds
• Time-course studies of apoptosis

MATERIALS REQUIRED
================================================================================

• Cells in culture
• CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent or similar caspase substrate
• Cell culture medium
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Fluorescence microscope or microplate reader
• Optional: NucBlue Live ReadyProbes Reagent for nuclear counterstaining

PROTOCOL
================================================================================

For live cell imaging (CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent)

1. Prepare cells in appropriate culture vessel (coverslips, multiwell plates, etc.).

2. Treat cells with apoptosis-inducing agent or control treatment.

3. Prepare CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent:
   - Add 100 µL of PBS to the dry powder to make a 100X stock solution.
   - Dilute 1:100 in cell culture medium to make working solution (final concentration typically 2-5 µM).

4. Remove cell culture medium from cells.

5. Add CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent working solution to cells.

6. Incubate for 30-60 minutes at 37°C, protected from light.

7. Optional: Add NucBlue Live ReadyProbes Reagent (1 drop per mL) for nuclear counterstaining.

8. Wash cells once with PBS or fresh culture medium.

9. Image cells immediately using a fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter set (FITC/GFP filter for green fluorescence).

For microplate reader detection

1. Seed cells in 96-well microplate.

2. Treat cells with apoptosis-inducing agent or control.

3. Prepare CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent as described above.

4. Add reagent to cells and incubate as described above.

5. Read fluorescence using a microplate reader:
   - Excitation: ~502 nm
   - Emission: ~530 nm

6. Calculate caspase activity relative to controls.

For flow cytometry

1. Prepare cell suspension.

2. Treat cells with apoptosis-inducing agent.

3. Prepare CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent working solution.

4. Add reagent to cells and incubate for 30-60 minutes at 37°C.

5. Wash cells with PBS.

6. Analyze by flow cytometry using FITC/GFP channel.

PROTOCOL TIPS
================================================================================

• Include positive control (cells treated with known apoptosis inducer) and negative control (untreated cells)
• Optimize incubation time based on your cell type and treatment
• Protect from light during incubation to prevent photobleaching
• For time-course studies, image at multiple time points
• Caspase activity typically peaks 2-6 hours after apoptosis induction
• Some caspase substrates are cell-permeant and work in live cells; others require cell fixation
• For fixed cells, follow manufacturer's instructions for fixation and permeabilization steps
