OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The sandwich ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is a highly sensitive immunoassay technique used to detect and quantify specific proteins or antigens in samples. This method uses two antibodies: a capture antibody that binds to the target antigen, and a detection antibody that recognizes a different epitope on the same antigen. The detection antibody is conjugated to an enzyme (such as horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) that produces a measurable signal.

MATERIALS REQUIRED
================================================================================

• 96-well microplate (pre-coated with capture antibody or uncoated for manual coating)
• Capture antibody (specific to target antigen)
• Detection antibody (conjugated to HRP or AP, specific to target antigen)
• Blocking buffer (e.g., 1% BSA or 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS)
• Wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20, PBST)
• Sample diluent (PBS or assay buffer)
• Standard/reference antigen (for standard curve)
• Substrate solution (TMB for HRP, or pNPP for AP)
• Stop solution (2N H2SO4 for TMB, or 3N NaOH for pNPP)
• Plate reader (capable of reading absorbance at appropriate wavelength)

PROTOCOL
================================================================================

Day 1: Plate Coating (if using uncoated plates)

1. Dilute capture antibody in coating buffer (typically 0.1 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, or PBS) to the recommended concentration (usually 1-10 µg/mL).

2. Add 100 µL of diluted capture antibody to each well of a 96-well microplate.

3. Cover plate and incubate overnight at 4°C, or for 2 hours at room temperature.

4. Remove the coating solution and wash plate 3 times with wash buffer (200-300 µL per well). Invert plate and tap on paper towels to remove excess liquid.

Day 2: Blocking and Assay

5. Add 200-300 µL of blocking buffer to each well.

6. Incubate for 1-2 hours at room temperature, or overnight at 4°C.

7. Wash plate 3 times with wash buffer as described in step 4.

8. Prepare samples and standards:
   - Dilute samples in sample diluent to appropriate concentration
   - Prepare standard curve by serial dilution of reference antigen in sample diluent
   - Include blank wells with sample diluent only

9. Add 100 µL of samples and standards to appropriate wells in duplicate or triplicate.

10. Cover plate and incubate for 1-2 hours at room temperature, or overnight at 4°C.

11. Wash plate 3-5 times with wash buffer as described in step 4.

12. Dilute detection antibody in blocking buffer or antibody diluent to recommended concentration (typically 0.5-2 µg/mL).

13. Add 100 µL of diluted detection antibody to each well.

14. Cover plate and incubate for 1-2 hours at room temperature.

15. Wash plate 3-5 times with wash buffer as described in step 4.

16. Prepare substrate solution according to manufacturer's instructions.

17. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.

18. Incubate at room temperature, protected from light, for 5-30 minutes (or until desired color development).

19. Add 50-100 µL of stop solution to each well (if using TMB or other substrates requiring stopping).

20. Read plate immediately using a microplate reader at the appropriate wavelength:
    - TMB: 450 nm (with 570 nm or 630 nm reference)
    - pNPP: 405 nm
    - OPD: 492 nm

DATA ANALYSIS
================================================================================

1. Subtract the average absorbance of blank wells from all sample and standard values.

2. Plot standard curve: absorbance (y-axis) vs. concentration (x-axis) using standard values.

3. Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of unknown samples.

4. For accurate results, ensure sample values fall within the linear range of the standard curve.

PROTOCOL TIPS
================================================================================

• Always include negative controls (no antigen) and positive controls (known concentration of antigen)
• Use fresh substrate solutions and prepare just before use
• Avoid bubbles when adding solutions to wells
• Ensure consistent incubation times and temperatures
• Wash thoroughly between steps to reduce background signal
• Optimize antibody concentrations and incubation times for your specific assay
• For best results, use high-quality, validated antibody pairs
