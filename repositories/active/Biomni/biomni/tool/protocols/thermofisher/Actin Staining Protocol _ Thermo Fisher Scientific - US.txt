INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

We offer several fluorescent and biotinylated phalloidin and phallacidin derivatives
for labeling F-actin. These phallotoxins, isolated from the deadly Amanita phalloides
mushroom, are bicyclic peptides that differ by two amino acid residues. They can be
used interchangeably in most applications and bind competitively to the same sites in
F-actin. Phalloidin and phallacidin contain an unusual thioether bridge between a
cysteine and tryptophan residue that forms an inner ring structure. At elevated pH,
this thioether is cleaved and the toxin loses its affinity for actin.

Fluorescent and biotinylated phallotoxins stain F-actin at nanomolar concentrations
and are extremely water soluble, thus providing convenient probes for labeling,
identifying, and quantitating F-actin in tissue sections, cell cultures, or cell-free
experiments. Labeled phallotoxins have similar affinity for both large and small
filaments, binding in a stoichiometric ratio of about one phallotoxin molecule per
actin subunit in muscle and nonmuscle cells from many different species of plants and
animals. Unlike antibodies, the binding affinity does not change appreciably with
actin from different species or sources. Nonspecific staining is negligible, and the
contrast between stained and unstained areas is extremely large. It has been reported
that phallotoxins are unable to bind to monomeric G-actin.

Phallotoxins shift the monomer/polymer equilibrium toward the polymer, lowering the
critical concentration for polymerization up to 30-fold. Phallotoxins also stabilize
F-actin, inhibiting depolymerization by cytochalasins, potassium iodide, and elevated
temperatures.

Because the phallotoxin conjugates are small, with an approximate diameter of 12–15 Å
and molecular weight of <2000 daltons, a variety of actin-binding proteins—including
myosin, tropomyosin, troponin, and DNase I—can still bind to actin after treatment
with phallotoxins. Even more significantly, phallotoxin-labeled actin filaments
remain functional; labeled glycerinated muscle fibers still contract, and labeled
actin filaments still move on solid-phase myosin substrates.

Fluorescent phallotoxins can also be used to quantitate the amount of F-actin in
cells. The unlabeled phallotoxins may be used as controls in blocking F-actin
staining or in promoting actin polymerization. Our biotin-XX phalloidin allows
researchers to visualize actin filaments by electron microscopy using standard
enzyme-mediated avidin/streptavidin techniques. Eosin phalloidin can potentially be
used for correlated fluorescence and electron microscopic studies. Deerinck and
co-workers reported that when eosin conjugates are excited in the presence of
diaminobenzidine (DAB), an insoluble, electron-dense DAB oxidation product is formed
that is easily visualized with either light or electron microscopy.

Even though phallotoxins have an LD50 of approximately 2 mg/kg when injected into
the mouse, the toxins of A. phalloides that are responsible for most of the symptoms
and fatalities associated with poisoning by this mushroom are the structurally related
amatoxins. The major in vivo lesions produced by injected phallotoxin occur in the
liver and are associated with stabilization of polymeric actin. Phallotoxins, however,
tend not to be absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract even though they are stable
between pH 3 and pH 9.


MATERIALS
================================================================================

Storage and Safety

Once reconstituted in methanol, the stock solutions are stable for at least one year
when stored frozen at –20°C, desiccated, and protected from light. It appears that
NBD phallacidin, and possibly all of these toxins, exhibit a small loss of activity
when stored in aqueous solution at 2–6°C for over three weeks.

While the amount of toxin present in a vial could be lethal only to a mosquito (LD50
of phalloidin = 2 mg/kg), it should be handled with care.

Materials Required but Not Provided

• Methanol
• PBS
• Methanol-free formaldehyde
• Acetone or Triton X-100
• Fluorescent or enzyme-conjugated streptavidin, as prepared in step 1.9, for use
  with biotin-XX phalloidin only
• BSA, optional
• Image-iT FX Signal Enhancer (I36933), optional
• lysopalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, optional

Preparing the Stock Solution

Fluorescent Phallotoxins

The vial contents should be dissolved in 1.5 mL methanol to yield a final
concentration of 200 units/mL, which is equivalent to approximately 6.6 µM. One unit
of phallotoxin is defined as the amount of material used to stain one microscope
slide of fixed cells, according to the following protocol (see step 1.6), and is
equivalent to 5 µL of methanolic stock solution for the fluorescent phallotoxins.

Biotin-XX Phalloidin

Staining cells with biotin-XX phalloidin (B7474) requires 1) the use of a higher
concentration of the phallotoxin conjugate than when staining with fluorescent
phallotoxins and 2) the addition of a fluorescent or enzyme-conjugated avidin or
streptavidin detection reagent (see step 1.9). The vial contents should be dissolved
in 0.5 mL methanol to yield a final concentration of 100 units/mL, which is
equivalent to approximately 20 µM. For biotin-XX phalloidin, 10 µL of the
methanolic stock solution is equivalent to one unit of phallotoxin, which is defined
as the amount of material used to stain one microscope slide of fixed cells
according to the following protocol (see step 1.6).

Unlabeled Phalloidin

Solutions of this product should be prepared just like the fluorescent phallotoxins
described in Fluorescent Phallotoxins, taking into account the larger quantity of
material provided.


PROTOCOL
================================================================================

The procedure below was originally developed for use with NBD phallacidin. It has
been successfully used with all of Invitrogen Molecular Probes phallotoxin
conjugates. This procedure may not be optimum for a particular experimental system,
but has yielded consistent results in most instances. The following protocol
describes the staining procedure for adherent cells grown on glass coverslips.

1. Formaldehyde-Fixed Cells

   1.1. Wash cells twice with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS).

   1.2. Fix the sample in 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 10 minutes at room
        temperature.

        Note: Methanol can disrupt actin during the fixation process. Therefore,
        it is best to avoid any methanol containing fixatives. The preferred
        fixative is methanol-free formaldehyde.

   1.3. Wash two or more times with PBS.

   1.4. Place each coverslip in a glass petri dish and extract it with a solution
        of acetone at –20°C or 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 to 5 minutes.

   1.5. Wash two or more times with PBS.

   1.6. When staining with any of the fluorescent phallotoxins, dilute 5 µL
        methanolic stock solution into 200 µL PBS for each coverslip to be
        stained. To reduce nonspecific background staining with these conjugates,
        add 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the staining solution. It may also be
        useful to pre-incubate fixed cells with PBS containing 1% BSA or with the
        Image-iT FX signal enhancer (I36933) for 20–30 minutes prior to adding
        the phallotoxin staining solution. When staining with biotin-XX phalloidin
        (B7474), dilute 10 µL of the methanolic stock solution into 200 µL PBS
        for each coverslip to be stained. When staining more than one coverslip,
        adjust volumes accordingly. For a stronger signal, use 2 or 3 units per
        coverslip.

   1.7. Place the staining solution on the coverslip for 20 minutes at room
        temperature (generally, any temperature between 4°C and 37°C is suitable).
        To avoid evaporation, keep the coverslips inside a covered container
        during the incubation.

   1.8. Wash two or more times with PBS.

   1.9. When using biotin-XX phalloidin, incubate for 30 minutes with 100 µL of a
        10 µg/mL solution of fluorescent or enzyme-conjugated streptavidin
        dissolved in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100 and
        1% BSA. Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature. After incubation,
        wash the coverslip with PBS. To develop enzyme activity, follow a
        procedure recommended for the specific enzyme.

   1.10. For long-term storage, the cells should be air dried and then mounted in a
         permanent mountant such as ProLong Gold reagent or Cytoseal. Specimens
         prepared in this manner retain actin staining for at least six months
         when stored in the dark at 2–6°C.

2. Simultaneous Fixation, Permeabilization, and Fluorescent Phallotoxin Staining

   The phallotoxins appear to be stable for short periods in 4% formaldehyde
   fixation buffers. This permits a rapid one-step fixation, permeabilization,
   and labeling procedure as follows.

   2.1. Prepare a 1 mL solution containing 50 to 100 µg/mL
        lysopalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and 3.7% formaldehyde and then add 5–10
        units of fluorescent phallotoxin (approximately 25 to 50 µL of methanolic
        stock solution).

   2.2. Place this staining solution on cells and incubate for 20 minutes at 4°C.

   2.3. Rapidly wash three times with buffer.

   2.4. Mount coverslips and view.


TIPS FOR FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY
================================================================================

Photostability or resistance to photobleaching is a primary concern when making
fluorescence measurements. Invitrogen brand product lines such as Alexa Fluor,
Oregon Green, BODIPY, and rhodamine fluorophores (including Texas Red™-X) are
significantly more photostable than NBD and fluorescein and will therefore enable
more accurate photographic measurements.

To further reduce photobleaching, minimize the exposure of fluorescently labeled
specimens to light with neutral density filters and expose samples only when
observing or recording a signal. Maximize collection of fluorescence by using a
minimum of optics, high–numerical aperture objectives, relatively low magnification,
high-quality optical filters, and high-speed film or high-efficiency detectors.

Invitrogen Antifade reagents, including Molecular Probes SlowFade Gold and ProLong
Gold antifade reagents, can extend the useful lives of many fluorescent probes.
These reagents are also available in a formulation with DAPI. They can be used on
fixed cell preparations but are not compatible with living cells. Cytoseal also
appears to protect BODIPY fluorophores from photobleaching.
