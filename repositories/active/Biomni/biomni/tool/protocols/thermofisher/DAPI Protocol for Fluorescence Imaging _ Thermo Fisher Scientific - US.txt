================================================================================

OVERVIEW
================================================================================

DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) is a blue-fluorescent DNA stain that binds strongly to A-T rich regions in DNA. It is widely used for nuclear staining in fluorescence microscopy applications. DAPI is cell-impermeant and is typically used to stain fixed cells, though it can also be used to stain live cells at higher concentrations.

APPLICATIONS
================================================================================

This protocol can be used for:
• Nuclear staining in fixed cells for fluorescence microscopy
• Cell counting and nuclear morphology analysis
• Counterstaining in multicolor immunofluorescence experiments

This protocol should not be used for:
• Flow cytometry (use DAPI Protocol for HCA Instruments instead)
• Live cell imaging (unless using higher concentrations and short exposure times)

MATERIALS REQUIRED
================================================================================

• Fixed cells (on coverslips, slides, or in multiwell plates)
• DAPI stain (e.g., DAPI, dihydrochloride, Cat. No. D1306, or DAPI solution)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Mounting medium (e.g., ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI, or add DAPI to mounting medium)
• Fluorescence microscope with DAPI/UV filter set (excitation ~358 nm, emission ~461 nm)

PROTOCOL
================================================================================

For fixed cells

1. Fix and permeabilize cells according to your standard protocol.

2. Wash cells 2-3 times with PBS.

3. Prepare DAPI staining solution:
   - For DAPI powder: Dissolve in water or PBS to make a 1-5 mg/mL stock solution. Store at 2-8°C, protected from light.
   - Working solution: Dilute stock to 1-5 µg/mL in PBS or mounting medium.

4. Option A: Staining before mounting
   - Remove PBS from cells.
   - Add DAPI working solution (1-5 µg/mL in PBS) to cover cells.
   - Incubate for 5-10 minutes at room temperature, protected from light.
   - Wash 2-3 times with PBS.
   - Proceed to mounting.

5. Option B: Staining in mounting medium (recommended)
   - Remove PBS from cells.
   - Add mounting medium containing DAPI (e.g., ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI, or add DAPI to mounting medium at 1-5 µg/mL final concentration).
   - Cover with coverslip and proceed to imaging.

6. Image cells using a fluorescence microscope with DAPI/UV filter set.

SPECTRAL INFORMATION
================================================================================

DAPI:
• Excitation maximum: ~358 nm (UV)
• Emission maximum: ~461 nm (blue)
• Standard filter set: DAPI/UV
• Compatible with: FITC, TRITC, Texas Red, Alexa Fluor dyes

PROTOCOL TIPS
================================================================================

• DAPI is light-sensitive; protect from light during staining and storage
• Optimal concentration may vary; start with 1 µg/mL and adjust as needed
• Higher concentrations (5-10 µg/mL) may be needed for some tissue sections
• DAPI can be used in combination with other fluorescent stains (use appropriate filter sets)
• For live cells, use higher concentrations (5-10 µg/mL) and minimize exposure time
• DAPI-stained samples can be stored at 2-8°C, protected from light, for several weeks
