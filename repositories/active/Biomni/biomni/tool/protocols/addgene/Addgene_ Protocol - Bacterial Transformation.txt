PROTOCOL: Bacterial Transformation
SOURCE: https://www.addgene.org/protocols/bacterial-transformation/
================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Transformation is the process by which foreign DNA is introduced into a cell.
Transformation of bacteria with plasmids is important not only for studies in
bacteria but also because bacteria are used as the means for both storing and
replicating plasmids. Because of this, nearly all plasmids (even those designed
for mammalian cell expression) carry both a bacterial origin of replication and
an antibiotic resistance gene for use as a selectable marker in bacteria.

Scientists have made many genetic modifications to create bacterial strains that
can be more easily transformed and that will help to maintain the plasmid without
rearrangement of the plasmid DNA. Additionally, specific treatments have been
discovered that increase the transformation efficiency and make bacteria more
susceptible to either chemical or electrical based transformation, generating what
are commonly referred to as 'competent cells.'

Many companies sell competent cells, which come frozen and are prepared for optimal
transformation efficiencies upon thawing.

For the highest transformation efficiency, we recommend that you follow the
instructions that came with your competent cells.

💡 PRO TIPS:

• Commercial competent cells range significantly in their transformation
  efficiency. The lowest efficiency cells (usually the least expensive) are fine
  for transforming plasmid DNA for the purposes of storage and amplification.
  Higher efficiency cells are more important if you will be transforming with very
  small amounts of DNA or if you're multiple plasmids at once.

• To save money, many labs also make their own competent cells. This is a
  relatively simple procedure and is useful for performing low efficiency
  transformations.

EQUIPMENT
================================================================================

• Shaking incubator at 37 °C
• Stationary incubator at 37 °C
• Water bath at 42 °C
• Ice bucket filled with ice
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Sterile spreading device


REAGENTS
================================================================================

• LB agar plate (with appropriate antibiotic)
• LB or SOC media
• Competent cells
• DNA you'd like to transform


PROCEDURE
================================================================================

1. Take competent cells out of -80°C and thaw on ice (approximately 20-30 mins).

2. Remove agar plates (containing the appropriate antibiotic) from storage at 4°C
   and let warm up to room temperature and then (optional) incubate in 37°C
   incubator.

3. Mix 1 - 5 μl of DNA (usually 10 pg - 100 ng) into 20-50 μL of competent cells
   in a microcentrifuge or falcon tube. GENTLY mix by flicking the bottom of the
   tube with your finger a few times.

   💡 PRO TIP: Transformation efficiencies will be approximately 10-fold lower
   for ligation of inserts to vectors than for an intact control plasmid.

4. Incubate the competent cell/DNA mixture on ice for 20-30 mins.

5. Heat shock each transformation tube by placing the bottom 1/2 to 2/3 of the
   tube into a 42°C water bath for 30-60 secs (45 secs is usually ideal, but this
   varies depending on the competent cells you are using).

6. Put the tubes back on ice for 2 min.

7. Add 250-1,000 μl LB or SOC media (without antibiotic) to the bacteria and grow
   in 37°C shaking incubator for 45 min.

   💡 PRO TIP: This outgrowth step allows the bacteria time to generate the
   antibiotic resistance proteins encoded in the plasmid backbone so that they will
   be able to grow once plated on the antibiotic containing agar plate. This step
   is not critical for Ampicillin resistance but is much more important for other
   antibiotic resistances.

8. Plate some or all of the transformation onto a 10 cm LB agar plate containing
   the appropriate antibiotic.

   💡 PRO TIPS:
   • We recommend that you plate 50 μL on one plate and the rest on a second plate.
     This gives the best chance of getting single colonies, while allowing you to
     recover all transformants.
   • If the culture volume is too big, gently collect the cells by centrifugation
     and resuspend in a smaller volume of LB so that there isn't too much liquid
     media on the agar plates. If the agar plate doesn't dry adequately before the
     cells begin dividing, the bacteria diffuse through the liquid and won't grow
     in colonies.

9. Incubate plates at 37°C overnight.


TIPS AND FAQ
================================================================================

How can I save time when carrying out transformations?

If you are not concerned with transformation efficiency (such as when you have a
tube of plasmid DNA and just need to transform bacteria so that you can grow up
more of the plasmid) you can save a lot of time by shortening or skipping many
steps and will still get enough colonies for your next step. Remember that each of
these shortcuts will reduce the efficiency of the transformation, so when higher
efficiency is needed follow the complete protocol.

• Thaw the competent cells in your hand instead of on ice
• Reduce step 4 from 20 - 30 mins to 2 mins on ice before heat-shock
• Shorten or skip the outgrowth (for Ampicillin resistance it is ok to completely
  skip the outgrowth, for the other antibiotics it is a good idea to outgrow for at
  least 20-30 mins)

I get very few if any transformants when transforming large plasmids (>10 kb) or
BACs, what can I do?

Chemically competent cells are fast and easy to use, but are less efficient at
taking up larger plasmids. If you need to transform large plasmids, it is a good
idea to use electro-competent cells. Instead of relying on the heat-shock to cause
the cells to take up the DNA, an electro-magnetic field is applied to the
cell/DNA mixture to induce membrane permeability. To do this you will need to
have access to an electroporator and the appropriate cuvettes. Follow the
manufacturer's instructions for each.

I got no transformants. What went wrong?

Check that you are plating on an LB Agar plate containing the correct antibiotic.
The resistance gene on your plasmid must match the antibiotic on the plate. You
should also add a positive control (many companies include a positive control
plasmid with their competent cells) to ensure that your transformation procedure
is working.

TIP: Sometimes less is more.

Although it may be counter-intuitive, you will often get higher transformation
efficiencies with less DNA, especially when using highly competent cells. If you
used 100-1000 ng of total DNA in a ligation you will often get more colonies if
you use 1 μl of a 1:5 or 1:10 dilution rather than 1 μl directly.
