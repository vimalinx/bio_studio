General Transfection Protocol
Recombinant Antibody Purification Protocol
Introduction
Transfections allow for transient expression of a gene of interest in cell culture. This protocol describes how to transfect suspension HEK293 cells with recombinant antibody plasmids using Polyethylenimine Max as a transfection reagent. After transfection and expression, the recombinant antibody can be purified for use in a variety of applications.
Sharing speeds science.
We believe that sharing the full details of our protocols supports reproducibility and accelerates science. Here, we list the specific equipment, reagents, and methods that we use in our lab at Addgene. Equipment and reagents from other vendors should produce similar outcomes when using these protocols. However, please be aware that your protocol may need to be adjusted to accommodate slight differences between products. Addgene does not endorse or recommend specific products or equipment. Inclusion of this information is solely for transparency intended to support reproducibility in science.
General Considerations
For antibody-expressing plasmids containing the SV40 origin of replication use a HEK293 line stably expressing the SV40 large T antigen.
For antibody-expressing plasmids containing the Epstein-Barr virus origin of replication use a HEK293 line stable expressing Epstein Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA).
Safety Warnings
HEK293 cells are considered biosafety level 2. Please ensure that you are in compliance with your institution’s biosafety regulations.

Before Starting
Warm the DNA and working stock of PEI-MAX to room temperature before use, and warm the BalanCD HEK293 transfection media (BCD TFX) to 37 °C. See below for other Reagent Preparation instructions.
Wipe down all pipettes and equipment with 10% bleach prior to use.
Reagent Preparation
100 mM Valproic Acid
Dissolve
2.88 g
valproic acid in
200 mL
deionized water
Sterilize by passage through a sterile 0.22 µm filter.
Prepare 10 mL aliquots and store the solution at -20 °C.
1 mg/mL PEI-MAX
Add
1 g
of PEI-MAX powder to
900 mL
deionized water in a 1 L bottle and stir on a magnetic stir plate.
Stir until all particles have dissolved. Note: The powder should dissolve rapidly (with 20 min) but check for the presence of particles still in solution. Continue to stir until all particles have dissolved. This may take several hours.
Adjust to
pH 7.0
with 10 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or 5 N hydrochloric acid (HCl). Note: Adjust the pH slowly, adding no more than 200 µL of NaOH or 20 µL of HCl at a time.
Add deionized water to a final volume of
1 L
and recheck pH to ensure that it has not drifted.
Filter the solution through a 0.22 µm filter.
Prepare aliquots and store at -20 °C until use.

Procedure
Section 1: Seeding cells
The day prior to transfecting, seed a
108 mL
culture of HEK293 cells at a density of
0.9 x 10
6
cells/mL
in a 500 mL vented flask.Incubate in a
37 °C, 5% CO
2
incubator on a shaking platform set to 120 rpm.
Pro-Tip
Do not use cells that are over 30 passages.
Section 2: Transfection
Check the cell density and viability:
Using a 5 mL pipette, transfer
0.5 mL
of HEK293 cell suspension into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
Pro-Tip
Cells settle quickly and need to be resuspended before sampling. Gently swirl the flask 5–10 times before sampling.
Transfer
10 µL
of trypan blue into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
Vortex the cell suspension.
Transfer
10 µL
of cell suspension into the microfuge tube containing the trypan blue.
Pipette 10 times to mix.
Load
10 µL
of the cell suspension/trypan blue mix into a cell counting chamber.
Load the cell counting chamber on an automated cell counter and measure the live cell density and viability of the culture.
Pro-Tip
Culture should be between
1.5–2 x 10
6
cells/mL
with
>95%
viability to proceed with transfection.
Transfect the flask containing 108 mL cells:
Transfer
6 mL
of BCD TFX into each of two 50 mL tubes.
Cap the tubes and incubate for
1 h
in the
37 °C
bead bath.
Transfer the PEI-MAX and recombinant antibody plasmid DNA sample to the biosafety cabinet and incubate for
1 h
at room temperature.
After the BCD TFX has warmed in the bead bath, transfer the tubes to the biosafety cabinet.
Add
180 µg
of recombinant antibody plasmid DNA to one tube of 6 mL BCD TFX. Cap the tube and vortex for 5 s to mix.
Add
450 µL
of 1 mg/mL PEI-MAX to the second tube of 6 mL BCD TFX (for a 1 mg/mL stock solution of PEI-MAX, 450 µg = 450 µL). Cap the tube and vortex for 5 s to mix.
Pro-Tip
The optimal ratio of DNA:PEI may vary significantly and should be empirically determined for your sample. Typical ratios may range from 1:1 to 1:6.
Add the diluted PEI-MAX to the diluted DNA. Cap the tube and vortex with three 1 s pulses.
Incubate for
3 min
at room temperature.
Transfer the flask of HEK293 cells to the biosafety cabinet.
Add
12 mL
of PEI-MAX/DNA mix to the flask dropwise.
Cap the flasks and swirl 5–10 times to mix.
Return the flask to the incubator.
Section 3: BCD Feed and valproic acid supplementation
During the
24–144 h
post-transfection, supplement the flask with 4% BCD Feed.
Pro-Tip
The feed can be repeated up to 4 times for a total of 16% of the culture volume.
At
72-96 h
post-transfection, supplement the flask with
3.75 mM
valproic acid.
Example feeding schedule:
Thursday: Transfect cells.
Friday (24 h post-transfection): Add 4% BCD Feed.
Monday (96 h post-transfection): Add valproic acid to 3.75 mM, add 4% BCD Feed.
Tuesday (120 h post-transfection): Add 4% BCD Feed.
Wednesday (144 h post-transfection): Add 4% BCD Feed.
Thursday (168 h post-transfection): Harvest antibody.
Section 4: Harvest antibody
At 168 hours (1 week) post-transfection, harvest the antibody.
Transfer the HEK293 cells and media to 50 mL conical tubes.
Centrifuge for
15 min
at
3100 x
g
to pellet the cells.
Filter the supernatant through a 0.45 µm PES filter.
Add
1X
protease inhibitor cocktail to the supernatant.
The supernatant containing the recombinant antibody can be used as-is or the recombinant antibody can be purified from the supernatant (see our
Recombinant Antibody Purification Protocol
).
Store the supernatant at
4 °C
until ready to use.
