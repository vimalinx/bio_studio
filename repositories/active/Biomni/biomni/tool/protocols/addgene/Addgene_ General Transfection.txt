PROTOCOL: General Transfection
SOURCE: https://www.addgene.org/protocols/transfection/
================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

This protocol describes a general method for transfecting mammalian cells using
linear polyethylenimine. Transfections allow for transient expression of a gene
of interest in a target cell line and can be useful for short term studies of
protein function. We specifically use this protocol with a subclone of HEK293T
cells optimized for viral production (AAVpro or Lenti-X), but any HEK293T cell
line should work. This approach can be adapted for different cell lines and
different transfection reagents.


WORKFLOW TIMELINE
================================================================================

Day 0: Seed HEK293T cells (or a subclone of HEK293T optimized for viral
       production)

Day 1: Transfect Cells

Day 2 (am): 18 h post transfection - Remove media, replace with fresh media

Day 3 or more (am): Observe fluorescence, harvest cells, or perform your
                    experiment


EQUIPMENT
================================================================================

• Class II, Type A2 Biological Safety Cabinet
• 0.5–10 µL single channel pipette
• 2–20 µL single channel pipette
• 20–200 µL single channel pipette
• 200–1000 µL single channel pipette
• Ice bucket
• CO₂ incubator
• Pipet controller
• Hazardous waste container


REAGENTS
================================================================================

• DMEM high glucose, Corning 10-013-CV
• L-alanyl-L-glutamine (or alternative stable glutamine such as glutaGRO,
  Corning 25-015-CI)
• Heat-inactivated FBS
• Low serum medium such as Opti-MEM or Opti-Pro SFM, Thermo Fisher, 12309019
• 25 mM chloroquine
• Polyethylenimine, linear MW 25,000 Da
• Microcentrifuge tubes, Neptune 3745.X
• 10 cm tissue culture dish, Corning 430167
• Hydrochloric acid
• Sodium hydroxide
• 0.22 μm polyethersulfone (PES) filter
• Syringes for filtering


REAGENT PREPARATION
================================================================================

DMEM Complete: 10% v/v FBS and 4 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine (or stable alternative
such as glutaGRO)

To a 500 mL bottle of DMEM high glucose, add 55 mL of heat-inactivated FBS and 5
mL of 100X glutaGRO. Store at 4 °C.

💡 PRO TIP: Different brands and lots of FBS can promote or inhibit
transfection. Test a variety of brands and lots of FBS to find one suitable with
your protocols. FBS can be purchased already heat inactivated or it can be
inactivated in the lab by heating to 56 °C for 30 min.

25 mM chloroquine diphosphate

1. Dissolve 0.129 g of chloroquine diphosphate salt into 10 mL of sterile water.

2. Filter sterilize through a 0.22 µm filter.

3. Aliquot 50–100 µL and store at -20 °C.

4. Aliquots can be thawed and stored at 4 °C prior to use. Thawed aliquots should
   be discarded after 1–2 months.

1 mg/mL polyethylenimine, linear MW 25,000 Da (PEI)

1. Dissolve 100 mg of powder into 100 mL of deionized water.

2. While stirring, slowly add hydrochloric acid until the solution clears.

3. Check the pH of the solution. Use hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide to
   adjust the pH to 7.0. Typically, the solution will be basic and will need
   adjustment with hydrochloric acid first.

   💡 PRO TIP: The pH of this solution will drift pretty rapidly upon addition of
   acid or base. Add only a few drops at a time, allow them to mix and recheck the
   pH to prevent over or undershooting the desired pH.

4. Allow the solution to mix for 10 min and then recheck the pH to ensure that it
   has not drifted.

5. Filter the solution through a 0.22 µm membrane.

6. Aliquot 500–1000 µL into sterile tubes.

7. Store the tubes at -80 °C.

8. After thawing the solution can be stored at 4 °C for up to 2 months. After 2
   months, discard the tube and thaw a new working stock.


CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE YOU START
================================================================================

• The health of the cell line is critical for obtaining high levels of virus.

• HEK293T cells should be split 3 times a week:
  - Monday: Plate 1x10⁶ cells in a 75 cm² flask in a volume of 15 mL.
  - Wednesday: Plate 1x10⁶ cells in a T75 flask in a volume of 15 mL.
  - Friday: Plate 8x10⁵ cells in a T75 flask in a volume of 15 mL.

• Do not add antibiotics to the media.

• Use cells that are below passage 20 for viral production.

• The optimal mass DNA:mass PEI ratio will need to be empirically determined for
  each new batch of 1 mg/mL PEI prepared.

• There may be variation between batches of PEI depending on the user,
  quantities of chemical used, volumes, pH adjustment etc. Consequently, each
  batch needs to be validated and the best ratio of mass DNA:mass PEI determined.


PROCEDURE
================================================================================

1. Seed HEK293T cells at 3.8x10⁶ cells per plate in DMEM complete in 10 cm
   tissue culture plates.

2. Incubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO₂ for ~20 h.

3. Gently aspirate media, add 10 mL fresh DMEM complete containing 25 µM
   chloroquine diphosphate and incubate ~5 h.

   For 10 mL of DMEM complete, add 10 µL of 25 mM chloroquine diphosphate.

4. Dilute 18.9 µg of DNA into 500 µL of Opti-Pro SFM.

   💡 PRO TIP: Endotoxins can inhibit transfection; therefore, plasmid DNA
   purification should include an endotoxin removal step. For high quality plasmid
   DNA, the plasmid should also be propagated in an endonuclease negative E. coli
   strain such as NEB stable.

5. Dilute 1:3 (µg DNA:µg PEI) in 500 µL total of OptiPro SFM (per 10 cm plate).

   56.7 µL of 1 mg/mL PEI, MW 25,000 Da in 443.3 µL of OptiPro SFM per 10 cm
   plate

   💡 PRO TIP: The ratio of µg DNA:µg PEI needs to be empirically determined.
   Once a batch of PEI is prepared, transfect cells with a fluorescent plasmid
   using a variety of ratios. Check the cells 1–2 days after transfection to
   determine what ratio gives the highest percentage of GFP positive cells.

   Refer to the table below for a possible range of ratios to test:

   Ratio of DNA:PEI | Amount of DNA (μg) | Volume of 1 mg/mL PEI (μL)
   -----------------|-------------------|---------------------------
   1:1              | 18.9              | 18.9
   1:2              | 18.9              | 37.8
   1:3              | 18.9              | 56.7
   1:4              | 18.9              | 75.6
   1:5              | 18.9              | 94.5
   1:6              | 18.9              | 113.4

6. Gently add the diluted PEI to the diluted DNA. Add the diluted PEI dropwise
   while gently flicking the diluted DNA tube. Incubate the mixture 15–20 min at
   RT.

7. Carefully transfer the transfection mix to your HEK293T cells. Add the
   transfection mix dropwise, being careful not to dislodge the cells.

8. Incubate the cells for 18 h, or until the following morning.

9. The following morning, carefully aspirate the media. Replace the media with
   15 mL of DMEM complete.

10. Incubate the cells 24–48 h before checking for protein expression.


SAMPLE DATA
================================================================================

Lenti-X 293T cells were transfected using 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:6 µg of pRosetta:µg
of PEI. The 1:2 and 1:3 ratios provided high transfection efficiencies as can be
seen here by the amount of green fluorescent protein expression (green in the
right panels) with a limited effect on cell growth.
