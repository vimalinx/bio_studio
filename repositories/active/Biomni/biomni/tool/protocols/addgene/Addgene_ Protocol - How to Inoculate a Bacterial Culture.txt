PROTOCOL: How to Inoculate a Bacterial Culture

================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Plasmids can carry one or more antibiotic resistance genes, which confer
resistance to a specific antibiotic to the bacteria carrying them. The presence of
an antibiotic resistance gene on a plasmid allows researchers to easily isolate
bacteria containing that plasmid from bacteria that do not contain it by
artificial selection (i.e., growing the bacteria in the presence of the
antibiotic).

Luria broth (LB) is a nutrient-rich media commonly used to culture bacteria in
the lab. LB agar plates are frequently used to isolate individual (clonal)
colonies of bacteria carrying a specific plasmid. However, a liquid culture is
capable of supporting a higher density of bacteria and is used to grow up
sufficient numbers of bacteria necessary to isolate enough plasmid DNA for
experimental use. The following protocol is for inoculating an overnight culture
of liquid LB with bacteria.


PROCEDURE
================================================================================

1. Prepare liquid LB. For example, to make 400 mL of LB, weigh out the following
   into a 500 mL glass bottle:
   • 4 g NaCl
   • 4 g Tryptone
   • 2 g Yeast Extract
   • and dH₂O to 400 mL

   Note: If your lab has pre-mixed LB agar powder, use the suggested amount,
   instead of the other dry ingredients above.

2. Loosely close the cap on the bottle (do NOT close all the way or the bottle may
   explode!) and then loosely cover the entire top of the bottle with aluminum
   foil. Autoclave and allow to cool to room temperature. Now screw on the top of
   the bottle and store the LB at room temperature.

3. When ready to grow your culture, add liquid LB to a tube or flask and add the
   appropriate antibiotic to the correct concentration (see Preparing Antibiotics
   below).

   Note: If you intend to do a miniprep, you will usually want to start 2 mL in a
   Falcon tube. For larger preps, you might want to use as much as a liter of LB
   in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask.

4. Using a sterile pipette tip or toothpick, select a single colony from your LB
   agar plate.

5. Drop the tip or toothpick into the liquid LB + antibiotic and swirl.

   Note: You can also use a long toothpick to select the colony, swirl it in the
   LB, and remove prior to incubating.

6. Loosely cover the culture with sterile aluminum foil or a cap that is not air
   tight. Alternatively, you could use vented bioreactor tubes, dual position
   snap-cap tubes, or permeable film to allow for aeration.

7. Incubate bacterial culture at 37 °C for 12–18 h in a shaking incubator.

   Note: Some plasmids or strains require growth at 30 °C. If so, you will likely
   need to grow for a longer time to get the correct density of bacteria since
   they will grow more slowly at lower temperatures.

8. After incubation, check for growth, which is characterized by a cloudy haze in
   the media (Figure 1).

   Notes:
   • Some protocols require bacteria to be in the log phase of growth. Check the
     instructions for your specific protocol and conduct an OD600 to measure the
     density of your culture if needed.
   • A good negative control is LB media + antibiotic without any bacteria
     inoculated. You should see no growth in this culture after overnight
     incubation.

9. Optional: For long term storage of the bacteria, you can proceed with creating
   a glycerol stock.

10. You can now isolate your plasmid DNA from the bacterial culture by following
    the Isolating Your Plasmid DNA protocol.


PREPARING ANTIBIOTICS
================================================================================

Create a stock solution of your antibiotic. Unless otherwise indicated, the
antibiotic powder can be dissolved in dH₂O. Addgene recommends making 1000X stock
solutions and storing aliquots at -20 °C.

To use, dilute your antibiotic into your LB medium at 1:1,000. For example, to
make 100 mL of LB/ampicillin growth media, add 100 μL of a 100 mg/mL ampicillin
stock (1000X stock) to 100 mL of LB.

Antibiotic Concentrations:

Commonly Used Antibiotics | Recommended Concentration
--------------------------|-------------------------
Ampicillin                | 100 µg/mL
Bleocin                   | 5 µg/mL
Carbenicillin             | 100 µg/mL
Chloramphenicol           | 25 µg/mL
Coumermycin               | 25 µg/mL
Gentamycin                | 10 µg/mL
Kanamycin                 | 50 µg/mL
Spectinomycin             | 50 µg/mL
Tetracycline              | 10 µg/mL


TIPS AND FAQ
================================================================================

What is the difference between high copy and low copy plasmids?

The copy number refers to the number of copies of an individual plasmid within a
single bacterial cell (Figure 2). Large plasmids usually have a low copy number
(approximately one or two copies per cell) and they need to grow for longer
periods of time (approximately 18–30 h). On the other hand, smaller plasmids can
be present in large numbers, 50 or more per cell, and have a high copy number.
High copy number plasmids should only need to be grown for 12–16 h on average.
Certain features of a plasmid may render it low copy regardless of plasmid size.
See the plasmid's info page to determine if your plasmid is high or low copy.

I didn't get any growth after overnight incubation. What went wrong?

• Try growing the culture for more time. Some bacterial cultures grow more slowly.
  Also, bacteria incubated at 30 °C rather than 37 °C often require longer
  incubation times.

• Double check that the antibiotic in your LB media matches the antibiotic
  resistance on your plasmid.

• If the bacteria on your LB agar plates are not fresh, you should streak your
  bacteria onto a new LB agar plate before growing in liquid culture.

• More aeration may help to increase the density of the culture. Normally cultures
  shake at 150–250 rpm, increase this to 350–400 rpm to obtain a higher cell
  density.
