INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

The pipette is an essential tool for nearly anyone in molecular biology. You'll use
a pipette in many scenarios to accurately dispense small amounts of liquid (think:
0.1 µL to 1 mL). When working in a laboratory, properly dispensing liquid ensures
the accuracy of your experiment and any changes to the amount you are dispensing can
negatively impact your experimental results. This protocol will guide you in
selecting the correct pipette and pipette tip and using the pipette.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
================================================================================

Anatomy of a Pipette

This front view photo of a P1000 pipette shows the plunger at the top, which is
used to draw and expel liquid into the pipette tip, the volume display which shows
the set volume for the the pipette, and the tip ejector ring at the bottom which
pushes the pipette tip off of the pipette.

This side view photo of a P1000 pipette shows the volume adjustment ring right
below the plunger. This ring changes the pipette volume. Below that is the tip
ejector button which is used to push the tip ejector down the pipette to remove the
tip.

Choosing a Pipette and Pipette Tips

Although there are many different types of pipettes that have different mechanisms
to disperse liquids, this protocol is focused on single channel pipettes. These come
in standard sizes: P2, P10, P20, P200, and P1000. The table shows the pipette with
the appropriate dispense volume:

Pipette    | Dispense Volume
-----------|----------------
P2         | 0.2 to 2 µL
P10        | 1 to 10 µL
P20        | 2 to 20 µL
P100       | 10 to 100 µL
P200       | 20 to 200 µL
P1000     | 100 to 1,000 µL

Each pipette should be used with the appropriate tips, which are made in a number of
sizes and colors depending on the pipette they are used with and the volume to be
dispensed. The boxes that the tips come in often indicate a volume range that the
tip can hold. This should give you an idea of what pipette to use with it.

The purpose of the pipette tip is so that the same pipette can be used for
measuring different samples without cross contamination as long as the tip is
changed between samples. Tips can come loose in a bag, or can come preloaded into
tip boxes. In either case, once assembled into their boxes, pipette tips can be
sterilized in an autoclave as needed to prevent contamination. When not in use, the
tip box should be closed to prevent contamination.

Reading the Volume on the Pipette

Although each pipette performs the same function, the numbers are read differently
on each type of pipette. This section will help you understand how to read each
display to dispense the correct amount of liquid reagent.

• P1000: The first red digit is thousands of µL, the middle is hundreds, and the
  third is tens. Therefore, 1000 µL would read as 100 from top to bottom, while
  650 µL would read as 065.

• P200: The first digit is hundreds of µL, the second is tens, and the third is
  ones. Therefore 100 µL would read as 100 from top to bottom, while 95 µL would
  read as 095.

• P20: The first digit is tens of µL, the second is ones, and the third (red)
  digit is tenths. Therefore, 10 µL would read as 100, while 2.2 µL would read as
  022.

• P2: The first digit is ones of µL, the second red digit is tenths, and the
  third (red) digit is hundredths. Therefore, 1 µL would read as 100, while 0.5 µL
  would read as 050.

Each volume display on these pipettes will also have small tick marks at the bottom.
For the P1000, this represents the ones. For the P200, this represents the first
decimal place. For the P20, this represents the second decimal place, and for the
P2 this represents the third decimal place.


PROCEDURE
================================================================================

How to Pipette

Now that you know the different parts of the pipette, how to select tips, and how to
read a pipette, you're ready to begin using the pipette. To the right is a photo of
how you might hold a pipette.

1. Without moving past the maximum possible setting on the pipette, set the desired
   volume of the liquid on the pipette. Depending on the pipette you're using, you
   will be rotating dials behind the numerical display or the top of the plunger of
   the pipette.

2. Select the pipette tip that is designed to fit your pipette. To load a tip onto
   a pipette, open the tip box and push the end of the pipette onto the tip. Do not
   touch the tips with your fingers to avoid contaminating the tip or puncturing
   your glove. Ensure that the tip is properly set on the pipette to ensure
   pipetting accuracy.

3. Once the pipette is set and you have the liquid you wish to pipette ready, push
   down the plunger. There will be multiple "stops" on the plunger, where you feel
   resistance while pressing down on the pipette. Stop at the first "stop." The
   first stop expels enough air from the pipette for an accurate measurement in the
   next step. The second stop is meant to expel excess liquid from the tip once
   you've reached step 8.

4. Continuing to hold down the plunger, gently lower the pipette tip into the
   liquid. Do not submerge the pipette itself into the liquid and avoid touching
   the pipette to the inside of the tube. Only the tip should be in the liquid.

   💡 PRO TIP: If pipetting from a relatively large container holding a small volume
   of liquid, tilt the container holding the liquid so that it's easier for the
   pipette tip to reach the liquid. Aim to let only the pipette tip into the
   container in order to avoid contaminating the contents.

5. Once the end of the tip is submerged, slowly release the plunger, allowing it to
   go back to its resting position.

6. Wait for the liquid to stop flowing into the pipette tip. Liquids of various
   viscosity have different flow rates. The more viscous a liquid, the lower the
   flow rate into the pipette tip.

7. Once the liquid has finished drawing into the pipette tip, lift the pipette so
   that the tip exits the liquid. When you lift the pipette tip out of the liquid,
   no liquid should drip from the tip. This could indicate that the tip is not on
   the pipette properly.

8. Place the pipette tip into the container you are using to hold the measured
   liquid (ex: another microcentrifuge tube, a bottle etc.). If there is already
   other liquid in the receiving tube, place the pipette tip into the liquid. If
   this is a new container, place the tip near the bottom of and gently in contact
   with the container (capillary action between the container and the liquid will
   help draw the liquid out of the pipette tip). Then, slowly press down on the
   plunger all the way to the second stop to release the liquid.

   💡 PRO TIP: Dispense until the first stop, wait, and then dispense to the second
   stop to expel any residual liquid in the tip.

9. Before releasing the plunger, lift the pipette tip out of the liquid. Once you
   are clear of the liquid you can slowly release the plunger. Remove the entire
   pipette from the container making sure not to touch the sides of the container
   with the pipette.

10. Discard the pipette tip by holding the pipette tip over your dedicated waste
    container and pressing on the tip ejector button. If pipetting biohazardous
    materials, be sure to discard into a biohazardous waste container.


CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Pipetting accurately and precisely is important since even small changes in the
volume could affect your experiments. Beyond knowing the proper way to pipette,
it's important for scientists to calibrate their pipettes to make sure that they
are properly tuned to dispense the correct amounts of liquid.

If you are pipetting the same amount of liquid into different tubes or into wells
of a microplate, you may consider using a multichannel pipette. Please watch
Addgene's protocol on multichannel pipetting to learn more.
