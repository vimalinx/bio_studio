PROTOCOL: How to Design Primers

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Oligonucleotide primers are necessary when running a PCR reaction. One needs to
design primers that are complementary to the template region of DNA. They are
synthesized chemically by joining nucleotides together. One must selectively block
and unblock repeatedly the reactive groups on a nucleotide when adding a nucleotide
one at a time. The main property of primers is that they must correspond to
sequences on the template molecule (must be complementary to template strand).
However, primers do not need to correspond to the template strand completely; it is
essential, however, that the 3' end of the primer corresponds completely to the
template DNA strand so elongation can proceed. Usually a guanine or cytosine is
used at the 3' end, and the 5' end of the primer usually has stretches of several
nucleotides. Also, both of the 3' ends of the hybridized primers must point toward
one another.

The size of the primer is very important as well. Short primers are mainly used
for amplifying a small, simple fragment of DNA. On the other hand, a long primer
is used to amplify a eukaryotic genomic DNA sample. However, a primer should not be
too long (> 30-mer primers) or too short. Short primers produce inaccurate,
nonspecific DNA amplification product, and long primers result in a slower
hybridizing rate. On average, the DNA fragment that needs to be amplified should be
within 1-10 kB in size.

The structure of the primer should be relatively simple and contain no internal
secondary structure to avoid internal folding. One also needs to avoid
primer-primer annealing which creates primer dimers and disrupts the amplification
process. When designing, if unsure about what nucleotide to put at a certain
position within the primer, one can include more than one nucleotide at that
position termed a mixed site. One can also use a nucleotide-based molecular insert
(inosine) instead of a regular nucleotide for broader pairing capabilities.


PRIMER PROPERTIES
================================================================================

Taking into consideration the information above, primers should generally have the
following properties:

• Length of 18-24 bases
• 40-60% G/C content
• Start and end with 1-2 G/C pairs
• Melting temperature (Tm) of 50-60°C
• Primer pairs should have a Tm within 5°C of each other
• Primer pairs should not have complementary regions

Note: If you will be including a restriction site at the 5' end of your primer,
note that a 3-6 base pair "clamp" should be added upstream in order for the enzyme
to cleave efficiently (e.g. GCGGCG-restriction site-your sequence).
