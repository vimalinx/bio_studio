PROTOCOL: CRISPR Library Amplification
SOURCE: https://www.addgene.org/protocols/pooled-library-amplification/
================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Please refer to our pooled library material pages for amplification protocols that
have been developed by the depositor for a specific pooled library available at
Addgene. We recommend following the depositor's specific protocol if one is
available. If a pooled library does not yet have an amplification protocol, the
following protocol can be used as a starting point for CRISPR libraries.

This protocol allows the amplification of a pooled-plasmid library in
Escherichia coli cells. Pooled libraries contain tens to millions of different
plasmids in a single sample. They are often used for screening, barcoding, or
other high throughput multiplexed experiments. These pooled plasmids differ by
only a short region of DNA: guide RNAs targeting different genes in an organism's
genome, for example.

Amplification is usually necessary to produce sufficient quantities of library for
experimental applications. Repeated amplifications should be avoided as best as
possible due to the inherent possibility of altering the composition of the
library. Bottlenecks, fitness differences, and plasmid recombination can all
impact the representation of individual plasmids in the pooled library during
amplification. This protocol is designed to be as general as possible but note
that individual libraries may require modifications dictated by the originating
laboratory for optimal results. If you obtained the pooled library from Addgene,
these protocols can be found on the Pooled Library page for the specific library.

This protocol assumes familiarity with standard bacterial transformation and
basic knowledge of the library being amplified. Please see our protocol on
Bacterial Transformation. The generalized pooled library amplification protocol
is expected to obtain satisfactory results for libraries up to 200,000 individual
plasmids and can be scaled according to the actual number.


REQUIRED QUALITY CONTROL (QC)
================================================================================

Pooled libraries can be challenging and expensive to ensure adequate quality, but
this upfront cost will save headaches and expense later.

At a minimum we recommend the use of a diagnostic digest and high-throughput next
generation sequencing (NGS). Select a restriction enzyme for digest that will
cut the shared plasmid backbone a single time and visualize that digestion on an
agarose gel (see restriction digest protocol here). Lentiviral plasmids can
recombine between their LTRs resulting in a smaller plasmid containing only the
elements required for bacterial propagation (origin of replication and antibiotic
selection). This recombination, at a low rate, is not typically a problem as
these sequences are not efficiently packaged into lentiviral particles. See below
for options if the recombinant band makes up a significant proportion of the DNA
pool.

WORKFLOW TIMELINE
================================================================================

Day 1: Transform, recover, set up overnight growth (Estimated time 2-3 hours)

    Transformation should be performed at the end of the day to ensure that
    growth times are limited.

Day 2: Harvest cells and purify DNA (Estimated time 3-4 hours)

    Cells should be harvested first thing in the morning to ensure that outgrowth
    and competition are limited.


EQUIPMENT
================================================================================

• Table top centrifuge
• BioRad Electroporator (MicroPulser TM, Bio-Rad 1652100)


REAGENTS
================================================================================

• 200 µL electrocompetent cells (Default: 4 tubes of Endura Duos, Lucigen,
  60242-1)

  Alternatives include Stbl4 cells or other ultra-high efficiency
  electrocompetent cells that are suitable for unstable or recombination-prone
  DNA.

  The use of electrocompetent cells is essential to ensure high efficiency
  uptake of plasmid library DNA.

  This quantity of cells is sufficient for libraries up to 200,000 individual
  plasmids. For larger libraries scale the number of cells and DNA accordingly.

  💡 PRO TIP: Use of extreme high efficiency (1×10¹⁰ cfu/µg) commercially
  prepared electrocompetent cells is strongly recommended.

• 800 ng pooled library DNA (100 ng plasmid DNA per 25 µL electrocompetent cells)

  Less library DNA can be used but this dramatically increases the chances of
  individual plasmids being lost from the pool and/or increasing the skewness of
  the pool.

• 8 electroporation cuvettes (BioRad, Micropulser, 0.1 cm)
• 20 mL SOC recovery media (Lucigen, 80026-1)
• 8X LB Agar + Antibiotic 245 mm bioassay plates (Molecular Devices, X602)

  💡 PRO TIP: Pour these plates at least one day in advance to allow adequate
  time to fully gel and to dry slightly. We routinely use 350 mL of LB Agar per
  bioassay plate.

• 14 mL Vented Falcon Tubes (BD Biosciences, 352059)
• 3X LB Agar + Antibiotic 65 mm Petri dish (VWR, 11019-552)
• 4 MaxiPreps (Qiagen HiSpeed Max, Catalog #12663)
• Tips (1000 µL, 200 µL, 10 µL)
• Bacti Cell Spreaders (VWR, 60828-680)
• 5 mL and 10 mL Serological pipettes
• Ice slurry (Ice bucket with ice and water to create slurry)
• 100 mL LB

  At Addgene we use premixed LB (VWR 101414-072) for convenience but any brand
  or house-made LB that supports normal growth is expected to work.

• 50 mL Falcon Conical tubes (Fisher, 14-432-22)


REAGENT PREPARATION
================================================================================

• Prepare, sterilize, and pour all LB Agar + Antibiotic plates.

• Prewarm 12 mL recovery media at 37 °C (for at least 15 minutes).

• Prewarm 3X LB Agar + Antibiotic plates at 37 °C.

• Prewarm 8X LB Agar + Antibiotic Bioassay plates.

• Prechill Micropulser cuvettes on ice.

• Thaw 4 tubes of electrocompetent cells on ice for 15-20 minutes or until
  completely thawed.

• Chill a box of 200 µL micropipette tips in a -20 °C freezer.

• Aliquot 3 mL SOC into each of four 14 mL Vented Falcon Tubes and have 1 mL SOC
  per electroporation readily available for post-electroporation recovery of
  cells.

• Ensure access to autoclaved, sterile reagents for all steps.


PROCEDURE
================================================================================

Day 1

1. Add 200 ng DNA to each 50 µL aliquot of thawed Endura Duos on ice. Flick
   gently to mix.

2. Electroporate cells (one at a time for a total of eight electroporations):

   Electroporator Conditions: Bio-Rad Micropulser Ec1 0.1 cm cuvette, 1.8 kV, 1
   pulse.

   a. Aliquot 25 µL DNA-Endura into pre-chilled cuvette.
   b. Pulse.

      Caution: Electroporation involves the use of high voltages, please use
      caution when activating pulse and follow all specifications described in the
      equipment manual.

   c. Immediately add 1 mL SOC to cuvette.
   d. Remove all liquid from cuvette and add to 14 mL vented Falcon Tube
      containing 3 mL SOC.
   e. Repeat for each of the 25 µl aliquots of cell/DNA mixture used (8 in the
      described protocol) using a new vented falcon tube for every two
      transformations. Each of the four 14 mL Vented Falcon Tubes should contain
      a total of 5 mL (3 mL SOC + 2 mL transformed Endura from two separate
      transformations).

   💡 PRO TIP: Do not pipette repeatedly or mix when removing SOC containing
   transformed DNA-Endura from cuvette.

3. Shake four 14 mL Vented Falcon Tubes at 30-37 ℃, 225 rpm for 1 hour.

4. After the 1 hour shaking period, pool and gently mix the four tubes.

5. Perform sequential 1:100 dilutions of the cells (add 10 µL of the pool to 990
   µL LB then perform a second and then third 1:100 dilution). Plate 100 µL of
   each dilution onto a prewarmed Petri dish.

6. Incubate plates at 30 ℃ overnight.

7. Plate 2.5 mL of the transformed cells on each of the eight bioassay plates (two
   plates per tube). Distribute evenly with a sterile spreader until all liquid
   has been absorbed by the agar. This usually takes 1-2 minutes.

   Critical: Be careful not to rip or shred the agar. Do so by gentle spreading.
   Some spreaders have a sharp edge that can scrape plates more abrasively at a
   certain angle.

8. Incubate plates upside down at 30 ℃ overnight.

   Critical: Ensure at this stage that no unabsorbed media drips onto the lid.
   Let plates remain agar side up until dried before overnight incubation if
   needed.

9. Place 100 mL sterile LB at 4 ℃.

Day 2 (morning)

1. Before beginning, prechill at least four conical tubes on ice and ensure
   access to sterile scraper and cold LB.

   💡 PRO TIP: Prepare one to two more conical tubes on ice in case you need to
   spread out the harvested cells further than four Maxipreps worth.

2. Count colonies on the most dilute Petri dish.

   Total colony yield = count × 100 × 100 × 100 ÷ 0.1

   This number should be at least 1000X greater than number of perturbations in
   library.

   Example: At least 10 colonies on the most diluted plate for 1000x coverage of
   a library of 100,000 plasmids.

   Colonies may appear small and require extra incubation time in order to be
   enumerated accurately.

   Frequently the number of colonies can be too great to count. Ideally,
   dilutions would have been sufficient to enumerate single colonies but as long
   as one can ensure more than the required colonies are present. If colonies are
   not present on the most dilute plate, count the second plate (ie. the 1:10,000
   dilution).

3. After 12-18 hours of growth, use spreader and cold LB to scrape bioassay
   plates and remove bacteria.

   • Use one scraper for all plates.
   • Use two 10 mL pipettes (one for dispensing cold LB and one for removing LB
     containing bacteria from plate).

   💡 PRO TIP: Scraped bacteria in LB can clog the pipette either mix gently up
   and down avoiding introducing bubbles or pour off plates into conical tubes as
   needed.

4. Add 10 mL cold LB to each plate for each scrape and use spreader to scrape
   plates.

   💡 PRO TIP: Pushing motion is better than pulling motion. Take care not to
   split or gouge agar during the scraping process.

5. Add each scrape into a 50 mL conical tube on ice pooling the scrapings of two
   plates into each tube. Keep each tube on ice while scraping.

6. Repeat addition of 10 mL cold LB and scrape for each plate until agar is clear
   (all bacteria have been removed). This should produce 25 mL cold LB-bacteria
   per plate.

7. Centrifuge tubes (4000 G, 4 ℃, 15 minutes) to pellet bacteria.

8. Decant LB and weigh pellet. The total weight of each pellet should be ~1-2 g.

   💡 PRO TIP: Make sure to weigh the empty tube beforehand! If you've already
   gone too far, weigh an identical empty tube. It will be close enough for the
   purpose of a Maxiprep.

9. Purify plasmid DNA using the Qiagen HiSpeed Maxi Kit (one conical is its own
   Maxiprep).

   Critical: Do not freeze pellets for later purification. Immediately purify them!
   Commercial Maxipreps rely on incremental, ordered cell lysis. E. coli cells
   are subject to lysis by freeze-thaw if not suspended in cryoprotectant like
   Glycerol or DMSO solutions.

10. Quantify the individual Maxipreps by Nanodrop, Picogreen, or Qubit.

    Each different DNA measurement type can report slightly different
    concentrations of DNA. In our hands fluorescent dye methods tend to report
    lower values than Nanodrop, although most protocols have been designed with
    Nanodrop as the quantification method.

11. If all Maxipreps appear to contain sufficient DNA for use, pool samples, and
    continue with analysis.

    "Sufficient" DNA will vary upon intended use. Typically yields range from
    several hundred micrograms to a milligram of total plasmid DNA.


TIPS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

What do I do if my transformation efficiency is not high enough?

Repeat the experiment with more cells, more DNA, gentler practices, and colder
reagents (not including the recovery media!). Do not proceed with Maxipreps or
NGS until adequate transformation efficiency is obtained. Ensure that
electrocompetent cells are being used. Chemically competent cells will not
provide adequate transformation efficiency! Ensure that no arcing is taking place
during electroporation. Arcing would manifest as a loud pop often accompanied by
some light in the cuvette during the electroporation step.

I got a heavy recombined band by digest.

Recombination is thought to be in part related to selective pressure. These
recombined plasmids are much smaller and are a smaller nutritional burden on the
bacteria. Bacteria that contain a recombinant plasmid likely grow faster in the
closed system of a crowded plate or culture. Try restricting growth to the bare
minimum by growing at 30 ℃, limiting growth time further, or potentially
spreading less bacteria on a given plate (example: by increasing the total number
of bioassay plates used). Scaling up the experiment using a Gigaprep can be used
to obtain sufficient intact pooled library even in the face of a recombined
fraction but care must be taken to perform adequate NGS based QC to ensure no
change in representation compared to the pre-amplified stock. A last option is
to perform a gel extraction of either the original sample or the amplified
sample, followed by reamplification of the DNA, but please note that NGS should
be performed to ensure representation is maintained.

Maxipreps - Less is more:

Do not overload the Maxipreps as yield can dramatically plateau and sometimes fall
off entirely if the column or reagents are significantly overloaded. If you find
that your pellet outstrips the capacity listed in the Maxiprep protocol, scale
the reagent volume and column number as needed. The use of Mega or Gigapreps is
acceptable when scaling up or reducing the number of tandem purifications. Consult
the manufacturers handbooks for appropriate volumes and numbers of tandem
purifications.
