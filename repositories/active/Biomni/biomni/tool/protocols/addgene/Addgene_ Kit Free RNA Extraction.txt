PROTOCOL: Kit Free RNA Extraction
SOURCE: https://www.addgene.org/protocols/kit-free-rna-extraction/
================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

This protocol describes how to extract RNA from tissues or cells without a kit. The
general steps of this protocol include homogenization/lysis of cells or tissues,
extraction of RNA, precipitation, and resuspension. This protocol provides two
options: using Solution D (see reagent section for recipe) or using an all-in-one
acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol solution such as TRIzol®. For the precipitation
step, two options are also included: using Isopropanol or Lithium Chloride.

This protocol was adapted from Chomczynski P and Sacchi N, 2006 and TRIzol® User
Guide from ThermoFisher Scientific.


BEFORE STARTING
================================================================================

RNA is not as stable as DNA and is susceptible to degradation by heat, RNases, and
other enzymes.

💡 PRO TIPS:

• Always wear gloves, and whenever possible, keep RNA sample and reagents cold and
  work quickly to reduce RNA degradation.

• Keep work area, equipment, and reagents RNase-free (Use an RNase decontamination
  solution, such as RNaseZap® or RNase AWAY®, may be used).

• For more tips on working with RNA, read this blog post on RNA extraction without
  a kit.

PROCEDURE
================================================================================

Option #1 - Solution D Protocol

Before starting this protocol, make sure to prepare solution D (see reagent
section above for the recipe). If using TRIzol®, jump down to the Option #2 -
TRIzol® Protocol section below.

1. Homogenize or lyse tissues or cells in Solution D.
   • For tissues: use 1 mL of Solution D per 100 mg of cells.
   • For cultured cells: use 1 mL of Solution D per 1 X 10⁷ cells.

2. Allow sample(s) to sit at room temperature for 5 minutes to allow for
   dissociation of the nucleoprotein complexes.

   The effectiveness of your RNA isolation will depend on how effective your cell
   lysis protocol is. While simple homogenization is effective for most mammalian
   tissues; more hardy tissues such as bone, or bacteria/yeast/plant samples will
   require additional steps to effectively lyse open the cells.

3. Extract RNA from the homogenized sample(s). Transfer tissue/cell lysate to a 4
   mL tube. Add the following sequentially to 1 mL of lysate:
   • Add 0.1 mL of 2 M sodium acetate (pH 4.0), mix thoroughly by inversion.
   • Add 1 mL water-saturated phenol, mix thoroughly by inversion.
   • Add 0.2 mL of Chloroform/Isoamyl alcohol (49:1) and then shake vigorously by
     hand for 10 seconds.

4. Incubate sample(s) for 15 minutes on ice and centrifuge the sample(s) for 15
   minutes at 12,000 × g at 4°C to separate RNA from the rest of the tissue/cell
   lysate.

   💡 PRO TIP: Having your samples spin at 4°C helps reduce RNA degradation. If
   you don't have access to a refrigerated centrifuge, you can carefully bring a
   centrifuge into a cold room for centrifugation. Once you're done using the
   centrifuge, bring this equipment back to room temperature, as prolonged storage
   in the cold room may damage it.

5. Using a pipettor, transfer the top, aqueous phase to a new RNAse-free tube.

   The mixture separates into a bottom organic layer, an interphase layer, and a
   top, aqueous layer. Take care to not disturb or collect the interphase layer
   with your pipette tip.

   💡 PRO TIP: To collect as much of the top aqueous phase without disturbing the
   interphase layer, consider using a lower volume pipettor like a p200 to collect
   a majority of the aqueous phase. You may have to collect twice or more from the
   same tube, but unlike using a p1000 tip it will give you more control of where
   you're aiming your tip in the tube.

6. Precipitate your sample(s). You can use either Isopropanol or Lithium Chloride
   for this step.

   Isopropanol (Option A): Add 1 volume of Isopropanol to the extracted aqueous
   layer. Incubate at -20°C for 1 hour.

   Lithium Chloride (Option B): LiCl selectively precipitates RNA versus DNA or
   proteins. Add the correct amount of 7.5 M LiCl solution to bring the
   concentration of LiCl in the extracted aqueous layer to 2.5 M. Incubate at
   -20°C for 1 hour.

   💡 PRO TIPS:
   • If you anticipate your RNA yield to be small, RNase-free Glycogen may be used
     as a carrier to facilitate RNA precipitation. This does not affect the quality
     of RNA or downstream applications.
   • To improve yield of RNA, instead of incubating at -20°C for 1 hour, you can
     try incubating at -80°C overnight.

7. Centrifuge for 20 minutes at 10,000 x g at 4°C and discard the supernatant.
   There should be a gel-like white pellet of total RNA in the bottom of the tube.

8. Wash the RNA by resuspending the pellet in 0.5–1 ml of 75% Ethanol and vortex
   for a few seconds. Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 10,000 x g at 4 °C and remove
   the supernatant.

9. Remove as much of the ethanol wash as possible without disturbing the pellet.
   Air-dry the pellet for 5-10 minutes.

   Critical: It is important to not let the pellet get too dry before resuspending,
   as this affects the solubility of the RNA.

   💡 PRO TIP: To prevent overdrying, watch the pellet and carefully remove any
   residual ethanol wash and add RNase-free water or TE as soon as the entire tube
   is dried but while the white pellet is still visible.

10. Resuspend RNA pellet in RNase-free water or TE. Quantify and assess the quality
    of your RNA sample(s) using a spectrophotometer (such as a Nanodrop), agarose
    gel, or bioanalyzer. For more information on nucleic acid quantification, see
    our protocol for DNA quantification, which can be modified for RNA. Store your
    RNA sample(s) at -80 °C to prevent RNA degradation and avoid multiple
    freeze-thaw cycles.

    💡 PRO TIP: To avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles of your entire RNA sample,
    consider making smaller aliquots of it and storing those in -80°C.

Option #2 - TRIzol® Protocol

1. Homogenize or lyse tissues or cells in TRIzol® or a similar product.
   • For tissues: use 1 mL of TRIzol® per 100 mg of cells.
   • For cultured cells: use 1 mL of TRIzol® per 1 X 10⁷ cells.

2. Allow sample(s) to sit at room temperature for 5 minutes to allow for
   dissociation of the nucleoprotein complexes.

   The effectiveness of your RNA isolation will depend on how effective your cell
   lysis protocol is. While simple homogenization is effective for most mammalian
   tissues; more hardy tissues such as bone, or bacteria/yeast/plant samples will
   require additional steps to effectively lyse open the cells.

3. Extract RNA from the homogenized sample(s). Add 0.2 mL of Chloroform/Isoamyl
   alcohol (49:1) per 1 mL of TRIzol® used. Shake vigorously by hand for 10
   seconds.

4. Incubate the sample(s) for 2-3 minutes on ice and centrifuge for 15 minutes at
   12,000 × g at 4°C to separate RNA from the rest of the tissue/cell lysate.

   💡 PRO TIP: Having your samples spin at 4°C helps reduce RNA degradation. If
   you don't have access to a refrigerated centrifuge, you can carefully bring a
   centrifuge into a cold room for centrifugation. Once you're done using the
   centrifuge, bring this equipment back to room temperature, as prolonged storage
   in the cold room may damage it.

5. Using a pipettor, transfer the top, aqueous phase to a new RNAse-free tube.

   The mixture separates into a bottom organic layer, an interphase layer, and a
   top, aqueous layer. If using TRIzol®, the bottom layer will be a red-pink
   color. Take care to not disturb or collect the interphase layer with your
   pipette tip.

   💡 PRO TIP: To collect as much of the top aqueous phase without disturbing the
   interphase layer, consider using a lower volume pipettor like a p200 to collect
   a majority of the aqueous phase. You may have to collect twice or more from the
   same tube, but unlike using a p1000 tip it will give you more control of where
