PROTOCOL: Restriction Digest of Plasmid DNA

================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Restriction enzyme digestion takes advantage of naturally occurring enzymes that
cleave DNA at specific sequences. There are hundreds of different restriction
enzymes, allowing scientists to target a wide variety of recognition sequences.
For a list of many commonly used restriction enzymes, visit NEB.

Restriction enzyme digestion is commonly used in molecular cloning techniques,
such as PCR or restriction cloning. It is also used to quickly check the identity
of a plasmid by diagnostic digest.

EQUIPMENT
================================================================================

• Electrophoresis chamber
• Pipetman


REAGENTS
================================================================================

• Liquid DNA aliquot of your plasmid of interest (see below for recommend
  amounts)
• Appropriate restriction enzyme (see manufacturer's instructions for proper
  amount)
• Appropriate restriction digest buffer (see manufacturer's instructions)
• Gel loading dye
• Electrophoresis buffer
• Pipet tips


PROCEDURE
================================================================================

1. Select restriction enzymes to digest your plasmid.

   💡 PRO TIP: To determine which restriction enzymes will cut your DNA sequence
   (and where they will cut), use a sequence analysis program such as Addgene's
   Sequence Analyzer.

2. Determine an appropriate reaction buffer by reading the instructions for your
   enzyme.

   💡 PRO TIP: If you are conducting a double digest (digesting with two enzymes
   at the same time), you will need to determine the best buffer that works for
   both of your enzymes. Most companies will have a compatibility chart, such as
   the double digest finder tool from NEB.

3. In a 1.5mL tube combine the following:
   • DNA
   • Restriction Enzyme(s)
   • Buffer
   • BSA (if recommended by manufacturer)
   • dH₂O up to total volume

   💡 PRO TIPS:
   • The amount of DNA that you cut depends on your application. A diagnostic
     digest typically involves ∼500 ng of DNA, while molecular cloning often
     requires 1 µg of DNA. The total reaction volume usually varies from 10-50 µL
     depending on application and is largely determined by the volume of DNA to
     be cut.

   • A typical restriction digestion reaction could look like this:
     - 1 µg DNA
     - 1 µL of each Restriction Enzyme
     - 3 µL 10x Buffer
     - 3 µL 10x BSA (if recommended)
     - x µL dH₂O (to bring total volume to 30µL)

   • The amount of restriction enzyme you use for a given digestion will depend on
     the amount of DNA you want to cut. By definition: one unit of enzyme will
     cut 1 µg of DNA in a 50 µL reaction in 1 hour. Using this ratio, you can
     calculate the minimal amount of enzyme for your reaction. However, keep in
     mind that restriction enzyme activity is determined under ideal conditions
     with very clean DNA, so using a little more enzyme is advisable. Reactions
     are often performed with 0.2-0.5 µL of enzyme because it is difficult to
     pipette less volume than this; 0.2-0.5 µL will likely be more enzyme than
     you will need, but that's okay because a little more enzyme is usually
     better.

4. Mix gently by pipetting.

5. Incubate tube at appropriate temperature (usually 37 °C) for 1 hour. Always
   follow the manufacturer's instructions.

   💡 PRO TIP: Depending on the application and the amount of DNA in the reaction,
   incubation time can range from 45 mins to overnight. For diagnostic digests,
   1-2 hours is often sufficient. For digests with >1 µg of DNA used for cloning,
   it is recommended that you digest for at least 4 hours.

6. If you will be using the digested DNA for another application (such as a
   digestion with another enzyme in a different buffer), but will not be gel
   purifying it, you may need to inactivate the enzyme(s) following the digestion
   reaction. This may involve incubating the reaction at 70 °C for 15 mins, or
   purifying the DNA via a purification kit, such as a QIAGEN DNA cleanup kit.
   See the enzyme manufacturer's instructions for more details.

7. To visualize the results of your digest, conduct gel electrophoresis.


TIPS AND FAQ
================================================================================

• Restriction enzymes MUST be placed in an ice bucket immediately after removal
  from the -20 °C freezer because heat can cause the enzymes to denature and lose
  their function.

• If you are having difficulty finding an enzyme that cuts your vector's
  multiple cloning site (MCS), but does not cut your insert, you could try using
  two different enzymes that have compatible sticky ends. See NEB's compatible
  cohesive ends chart.

• If you cannot find compatible sticky ends, you will need to fill in the
  overhangs and conduct a blunt end ligation. Use T4 DNA Polymerase or Klenow
  DNA Polymerase I for 3′ overhang removal and 5′ overhang fill-in.

• If you are using blunt ends or a single enzyme to cut the vector, you will need
  to use a phosphatase to prevent re-circularization of the vector if you are
  cloning in an insert. CIP (calf alkaline phosphatase) or SAP (shrimp alkaline
  phosphatase) are commonly used. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.

• If your enzyme did not cut, check to make sure that it isn't methylation
  sensitive. Plasmids grown in Dam or Dcm methylase positive strains will be
  resistant to cleavage at certain restriction sites. See NEB's table of
  methylation sensitive restriction sites.

• Sometimes enzymes cut sequences which are similar, but not identical, to their
  recognition sites. This is due to "Star Activity" and can happen for a variety
  of reasons, including high glycerol concentration. Learn more at NEB's website
  about star activity.

• If you are digesting a large number of plasmids with the same enzyme(s) (for
  instance, in a diagnostic digest), you can create a "Master Mix" consisting of
  all of the reaction components except for the DNA. Aliquot your DNA into
  individual tubes and then add the appropriate amount of Master Mix to each
  tube. This will save you time and ensure consistency across the reactions.
