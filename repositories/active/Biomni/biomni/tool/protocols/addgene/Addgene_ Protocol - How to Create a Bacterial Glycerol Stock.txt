PROTOCOL: How to Create a Bacterial Glycerol Stock

================================================================================

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
================================================================================

Bacterial glycerol stocks are important for long-term storage of plasmids.
Although you can store your plasmid DNA at -20°C, many labs also create bacterial
glycerol stocks of their plasmids. This way, when you want to make more plasmid
DNA, the plasmid will already be in your desired bacterial strain and you will not
need to obtain more competent cells and retransform.

Bacteria on an LB agar plate can be stored at 4°C for a few weeks. However, if
you want to store bacteria for a longer time, you will need to establish glycerol
stocks. The addition of glycerol stabilizes the frozen bacteria, preventing damage
to the cell membranes and keeping the cells alive. A glycerol stock of bacteria
can be stored stably at -80°C for many years.


PROCEDURE
================================================================================

1. Follow the steps for Inoculating an Overnight Liquid Culture.

2. After you have bacterial growth, add 500 μL of the overnight culture to 500 μL
   of 50% glycerol in a 2 mL screw top tube or cryovial and gently mix.

   Notes:
   • Make the 50% glycerol solution by diluting 100% glycerol in dH₂O.
   • Snap top tubes are not recommended as they can open unexpectedly at -80°C.

3. Freeze the glycerol stock tube at -80°C. The stock is now stable for years, as
   long as it is kept at -80°C. Subsequent freeze and thaw cycles reduce shelf
   life.

4. To recover bacteria from your glycerol stock, open the tube and use a sterile
   loop, toothpick or pipette tip to scrape some of the frozen bacteria off of the
   top. Do not let the glycerol stock unthaw!

5. Streak the bacteria onto an LB agar plate.

6. Grow your bacteria overnight at the appropriate temperature. Growth conditions,
   including copy number and growth temperature, can be found on your plasmid's
   information page. The next day you will be able to start an overnight culture
   for plasmid DNA prep the following day.


TIPS AND FAQ
================================================================================

• The optimal concentration of long-term glycerol storage is unknown. Most labs
  store bacteria in 15-25% glycerol.

• You can prepare the glycerol stock the same time you prepare your plasmid DNA.
  In the morning, when you retrieve your liquid bacterial culture, take 500 μL of
  culture to make your glycerol stock before you begin your plasmid mini-prep.

• Try not to freeze/thaw your glycerol stock too many times. Placing the glycerol
  stock on dry ice while streaking onto LB agar will prevent it from thawing
  completely and will improve the shelf life.

• It is very important that you shake the glycerol before freezing (5-6 times).
  Make sure that you see one uniform solution, and there are no layers present.

• Be sure to label both the lid and the tube of a glycerol stock before you place
  the sample at -80°C. Frozen tubes are hard to write on and samples stored for
  long periods at -80°C can lose labels stuck to tube!
