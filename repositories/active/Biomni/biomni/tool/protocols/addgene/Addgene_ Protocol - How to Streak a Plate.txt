PROTOCOL: How to Streak a Plate

================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

If you have a glycerol stock or stab culture of bacteria and need to purify plasmid
DNA from it, you will want to isolate an individual clonal population (single
colony) of bacteria from this stock. Using a single colony from a freshly streaked
agar plate to inoculate a bacterial culture for DNA purification will minimize the
chance of having a mixture of plasmids in your purified DNA. This protocol explains
how to isolate a single bacterial colony by streaking it onto an LB agar plate.

EQUIPMENT
================================================================================

• Sterile toothpicks or wire loop
• Bunsen burner (or other small flame source)
• Incubator
• Marker


REAGENTS
================================================================================

• LB agar plate (with appropriate antibiotic)
• Bacterial stab


PROCEDURE
================================================================================

1. Obtain an LB agar plate with appropriate antibiotic.

2. Label the bottom of the plate with the plasmid name and the date. It is also a
   good idea to add the antibiotic resistance and your initials. Labeling within a
   laboratory setting is important for organization, and it is recommended that you
   keep a standard labeling system for all your objects/solutions.

3. Sterilize your lab bench by spraying it down with 70% ethanol and wiping it down
   with a paper towel. Maintain sterility by working near a flame or bunsen burner.

4. Obtain the appropriate bacterial stab or glycerol stock.

5. Using a sterile loop, pipette tip or toothpick, touch the bacteria growing within
   the punctured area of the stab culture or the top of the glycerol stock.

   💡 PRO TIP: If you use a wire loop you can sterilize it by passing it through a
   flame, just be sure to allow enough time for the loop to cool before touching it
   to the bacteria.

6. Gently spread the bacteria over a section of the plate, as shown in the diagram
   above, to create streak #1.

   💡 PRO TIPS:
   • Hold your tooth pick at an angle, the way you would hold a pencil, so that you
     can make a broad stroke. Only touch the surface of the plate, do NOT dig into
     the agar.
   • Another very popular technique is to draw in discontinuous lines. Start by
     streaking a vertical line of bacteria along one edge of the plate. Then streak
     horizontal lines in another section of the plate, and then diagonal lines in
     another section of the plate. Make sure that the first line (and only the
     first) in each new section crosses at least one line of the previous section
     so that it will contain some bacteria.

7. Using a fresh, sterile toothpick, or freshly sterilized loop, drag through
   streak #1 and spread the bacteria over a second section of the plate, to create
   streak #2.

8. Using a third sterile pipette tip, toothpick, or sterilized loop, drag through
   streak #2 and spread the bacteria over the last section of the plate, to create
   streak #3.

9. Incubate plate with newly plated bacteria overnight (12-18 hours) at 37 °C.

   💡 PRO TIP: Some plasmids or bacteria need to be grown at 30 °C instead of 37 °C.
   This is often true for large unstable plasmids, which sometimes recombine at 37
   °C. Be sure to check this before incubating your plate.

10. In the morning, single colonies should be visible. A single colony should look
    like a white dot growing on the solid medium. This dot is composed of millions
    of genetically identical bacteria that arose from a single bacterium. If the
    bacterial growth is too dense and you do not see single colonies, re-streak
    onto a new agar plate to obtain single colonies.

11. Once you have single colonies, you can proceed to Recovering Plasmid DNA or use
    the individual colonies for other experiments.
