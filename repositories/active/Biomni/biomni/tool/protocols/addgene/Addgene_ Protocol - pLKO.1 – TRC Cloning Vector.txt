A. pLKO.1-TRC CLONING VECTOR
================================================================================

A.1 The RNAi Consortium

The pLKO.1 cloning vector is the backbone upon which The RNAi Consortium has built
a library of shRNAs directed against 15,000 human and 15,000 mouse genes. Addgene
is working with the TRC to make this shRNA cloning vector available to the
scientific community. Please cite Moffat et al., Cell 2006 Mar; 124(6):1283-98
(PubMed PMID 16564017) in all publications arising from the use of this vector.

A.2 Map of pLKO.1

pLKO.1 is a replication-incompetent lentiviral vector chosen by the TRC for
expression of shRNAs. pLKO.1 can be introduced into cells via direct transfection,
or can be converted into lentiviral particles for subsequent infection of a target
cell line. Once introduced, the puromycin resistance marker encoded in pLKO.1
allows for convenient stable selection.

pLKO.1 contains an shRNA insert. The original pLKO.1-TRC cloning vector has a 1.9kb
stuffer that is released by digestion with AgeI and EcoRI. shRNA oligos are cloned
into the AgeI and EcoRI sites in place of the stuffer. The AgeI site is destroyed
in most cases (depending on the target sequence), while the EcoRI site is preserved.
For a complete map of pLKO.1 containing the 1.9kb stuffer, visit
www.addgene.org/10878/.

Vector Elements:

• U6: Human U6 promoter drives RNA Polymerase III transcription for generation of
  shRNA transcripts.

• cPPT: Central polypurine tract, cPPT, improves transduction efficiency by
  facilitating nuclear import of the vector's preintegration complex in the
  transduced cells.

• hPGK: Human phosphoglycerate kinase promoter drives expression of puromycin.

• Puro R: Puromycin resistance gene for selection of pLKO.1 plasmid in mammalian
  cells.

• sin 3'LTR: 3' Self-inactivating long terminal repeat.

• f1 ori: f1 bacterial origin of replication.

• Amp R: Ampicillin resistance gene for selection of pLKO.1 plasmid in bacterial
  cells

• pUC ori: pUC bacterial origin of replication.

• 5'LTR: 5' long terminal repeat.

• RRE: Rev response element.

B. DESIGNING shRNA OLIGOS FOR pLKO.1
================================================================================

B.1 Determining the Optimal 21-mer Targets in your Gene

Selection of suitable 21-mer targets in your gene is the first step toward
efficient gene silencing. Methods for target selection are continuously being
improved. Below are suggestions for target selection.

1. Use an siRNA selection tool to determine a set of top-scoring targets for your
   gene. For example, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research hosts an
   siRNA Selection Program that can be accessed after a free registration.

2. Guidelines for designing siRNAs with effective gene silencing:
   • Starting at 25nt downstream of the start codon (ATG), search for 21nt sequences
     that match the pattern AA(N₁₉). If no suitable match is found, search for
     NAR(N₁₇)YNN, where N is any nucleotide, R is a purine (A,G), and Y is a
     pyrimidine (C,U).
   • G-C content should be 36-52%.
   • Sense 3' end should have low stability – at least one A or T between position
     15-19.
   • Avoid targeting introns.
   • Avoid stretches of 4 or more nucleotide repeats, especially repeated Ts because
     polyT is a termination signal for RNA polymerase III.

   Note that these were the prevailing guidelines when the pLKO.1 vector was
   created.

   Additional design rules can be found at the Broad Institute's TRC shRNA Design
   Process.

3. To minimize degradation of off-target mRNAs, use NCBI's BLAST program. Select
   sequences that have at least 3 nucleotide mismatches to all unrelated genes.

   TIP: Addgene recommends that you select multiple target sequences for each gene.
   Some sequences will be more effective than others. In addition, demonstrating
   that two different shRNAs that target the same gene can produce the same
   phenotype will alleviate concerns about off-target effects.

B.2 Ordering Oligos Compatible with pLKO.1

To generate oligos for cloning into pLKO.1, insert your sense and antisense
sequences from step B.1 into the oligos below. Do not change the ends; these bases
are important for cloning the oligos into the pLKO.1 TRC-cloning vector.

Forward oligo: 5' CCGG—21bp sense—CTCGAG—21bp antisense—TTTTTG 3'

Reverse oligo: 5' AATTCAAAAA—21bp sense—CTCGAG—21bp antisense 3'

For example, if the target sequence is (AA)TGCCTACGTTAAGCTATAC, the oligos would
be:

Forward oligo: 5' CCGG AATGCCTACGTTAAGCTATAC CTCGAG GTATAGCTTAACGTAGGCATT TTTTTG 3'

Reverse oligo: 5' AATTCAAAAA AATGCCTACGTTAAGCTATAC CTCGAG GTATAGCTTAACGTAGGCATT 3'


C. CLONING OLIGOS INTO pLKO.1
================================================================================

The pLKO.1-TRC cloning vector contains a 1.9kb stuffer that is released upon
digestion with EcoRI and AgeI. The oligos from section B contain the shRNA sequence
flanked by sequences that are compatible with the sticky ends of EcoRI and AgeI.
Forward and reverse oligos are annealed and ligated into the pLKO.1 vector,
producing a final plasmid that expresses the shRNA of interest.

C.1 Recommended Materials

• AgeI, New England Biolabs (NEB) #R0552S
• EcoRI, NEB #R0101S
• NEB buffer 1, NEB #B7001S
• NEB buffer 2, NEB #B7002S
• T4 DNA ligase, NEB #M0202S
• T4 DNA ligase buffer, NEB #B0202S
• DH5 alpha competent cells, Invitrogen #18258-012
• Qiaquick gel extraction kit, Qiagen #28704
• Low melting point agarose, Sigma #A9414
• Luria Broth Agar (LB agar), American Bioanalytical: #AB01200-02000
• Ampicillin, VWR: #7177-48-2. Use at 100 μg/mL.
• Carbenicillin, VWR: #80030-956. Use at 100 μg/mL.

C.2 Annealing Oligos

1. Resuspend oligos in ddH₂O to a concentration of 20 μM, then mix:
   • 5 μL Forward oligo
   • 5 μL Reverse oligo
   • 5 μL 10x NEB buffer 2
   • 35 μL ddH₂O

2. Incubate for 4 minutes at 95°C in a PCR machine or in a beaker of boiling water.

3. If using a PCR machine, incubate the sample at 70°C for 10 minutes then slowly
   cool to room temperature over the period of several hours. If using a beaker of
   water, remove the beaker from the flame, and allow the water to cool to room
   temperature. This will take a few hours, but it is important for the cooling to
   occur slowly for the oligos to anneal.

C.3 Digesting pLKO.1 TRC Cloning Vector

The following steps were the prevailing guidelines when the pLKO.1 vector was
created. For alternative options, please refer to the enzyme manufacturer's
resources, such as NEB's online tool NEBcloner, to help guide your reaction buffer
selection when setting up double digests.

1. Digest pLKO.1 TRC-cloning vector with AgeI. Mix:
   • 6 μg pLKO.1 TRC-cloning vector (maxiprep or miniprep DNA)
   • 5 μL 10x NEB buffer 1
   • 1 μL AgeI
   • add ddH₂O to bring to 50 μL final volume

2. Incubate at 37°C for 2 hours.

3. Purify with Qiaquick gel extraction kit. Elute in 30 μL of ddH₂O.

4. Digest eluate with EcoRI. Mix:
   • 30 μL pLKO.1 TRC-cloning vector digested with AgeI
   • 5 μL 10x NEB buffer for EcoRI
   • 1 μL EcoRI
   • 14 μL ddH₂O

5. Incubate at 37°C for 2 hours.

6. Run digested DNA on 0.8% low melting point agarose gel until you can distinctly
   see 2 bands, one 7kb and one 1.9kb. Cut out the 7kb band and place in a sterile
   microcentrifuge tube.

   TIP: When visualizing DNA fragments to be used for ligation, use only
   long-wavelength UV light. Short wavelength UV light will increase the chance of
   damaging the DNA.

7. Purify the DNA using a Qiaquick gel extraction kit. Elute in 30 μL of ddH₂O.

8. Measure the DNA concentration.

C.4 Ligating and Transforming into Bacteria

1. Use your ligation method of choice. For a standard T4 ligation, mix:
   • 2 μL annealed oligo from step C.2
   • 20 ng digested pLKO.1 TRC-cloning vector from step C.3 (If you were unable to
     measure the DNA concentration, use 1 μL)
   • 2 μL 10x NEB T4 DNA ligase buffer
   • 1 μL NEB T4 DNA ligase
   • add ddH₂O to bring to 20 μL final volume

2. Incubate at 16°C for 4-20 hours.

3. Transform 2 μL of ligation mix into 25 μL competent DH5 alpha cells, following
   manufacturer's protocol. Plate on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin
   or carbenicillin (an ampicillin analog).

   Due to the long terminal repeats found in lentiviral plasmids, Addgene
   currently recommends using a strain that reduces the frequency of homologous
   recombination of unstable regions, such as Invitrogen Stbl3™ or NEB Stable
   cells. This will ensure that the repeats will be maintained and often results in
   a greater yield of DNA.


D. SCREENING FOR INSERTS
================================================================================

You may screen for plasmids that were successfully ligated by restriction enzyme
digestion. However, once you have identified the positive clones, it is important
to verify the insert by conducting a sequencing reaction.

D.1 Recommended Materials

• DNA Miniprep Kit, Qiagen #27104
• EcoRI, NEB #R0101S
• NcoI, NEB #R0193S
• Agarose, Sigma #A9539

D.2 Screening for Inserts

Day 1:

1. Inoculate 5 colonies from each ligation into LB + 100 μg/mL ampicillin or
   carbenicillin.

Day 2:

2. Spin down the cultures and use a miniprep kit to obtain DNA.

3. Conduct a restriction digest with EcoRI and NcoI:
   • 1 μg miniprep DNA
   • 2 μL 10x NEB buffer for EcoRI
   • 0.8 μL EcoRI
   • 0.8 μL NcoI
   • add ddH₂O to bring to 20 μL final volume

4. Incubate at 37°C for 1-2 hours.

5. Run the digestion products on a 1% agarose gel. You should see two fragments, a
   2kb fragment and a 5kb fragment.

6. Sequence positive clones with pLKO.1 sequencing primer (5' CAA GGC TGT TAG AGA
   GAT AAT TGG A 3').

   TIP: You may need to adjust the sequencing conditions if the DNA polymerase has
   difficulty reading through the secondary structure of the hairpin sequence.


E. PRODUCING LENTIVIRAL PARTICLES
================================================================================

Before this step, you must contact your institution's Bio-Safety office to receive
permission and institution-specific instructions. You must follow safety procedures
and work in an environment (e.g. BL2+) suitable for handling HIV-derivative
viruses.

For transient knockdown of protein expression, you may transfect plasmid DNA
directly into the target cells. The shRNA will be expressed, but the DNA is
unlikely to be integrated into the host genome.

For stable loss-of-function experiments, Addgene recommends that you generate
lentiviral particles and infect the target cells. Addition of puromycin will allow
you to select for cells that stably express your shRNA of interest.

E.1 Recommended Materials

• psPAX2, Addgene #12260
• pMD2.G, Addgene #12259
• HEK-293T cells, GenHunter: #Q401
• FuGENE® 6 Transfection Reagent, Roche Applied Biosciences: #11814443001
• OPTI-MEM® serum-free media, Invitrogen: #31985
• Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), Invitrogen: #11995
• Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), Invitrogen: #16000
• Penicillin/Streptomycin, Invitrogen: #15140-122
• Polypropylene tubes, VWR: #87003-290

Note: pLKO.1 could also be packaged using pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr and pCMV-VSVG from the
Robert Weinberg lab. For more information, visit Addgene's Mammalian RNAi Tools
page.

E.2 Protocol for Producing Lentiviral Particles

This protocol is for transfection in a 6 cm plate. The protocol can be scaled to
produce different amounts of virus as needed.

Day 1:

a. For each plasmid to be transfected, plate 7×10⁵ HEK-293T cells in 5 mL of media
   in a 6 cm tissue culture plate. Incubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO₂ overnight.

   Although cells should regularly be passaged in DMEM + 10% FBS with
   penicillin/streptomycin, cells should be plated at this step in DMEM + 10% FBS
   without antibiotics (no penicillin or streptomycin).

Day 2:

b. Perform the transfection in the late afternoon because the transfection mix
   should only be incubated with the cells for 12-15 hours.

c. In polypropylene microfuge tubes (do NOT use polystyrene tubes), make a cocktail
   for each transfection:
   • 1 μg pLKO.1 shRNA plasmid
   • 750 ng psPAX2 packaging plasmid
   • 250 ng pMD2.G envelope plasmid
   • to 20 μl serum-free OPTI-MEM

   TIP: You may want to vary the ratio of shRNA plasmid, packaging plasmid, and
   envelope plasmid to obtain the ratio that gives you the optimal viral production.

d. Create a master mix of FuGENE® 6 transfection reagent in serum-free OPTI-MEM.
   Calculate the amount of Fugene® and OPTI-MEM necessary given that each reaction
   will require 6 μL FuGENE® + 74 μL OPTI-MEM. For example:
   • 1x master mix: 6 μL FuGENE® + 74 μL OPTI-MEM
   • 5x master mix: 30 μL FuGENE® + 370 μL OPTI-MEM
   • 10x master mix: 60 μL FuGENE® + 740 μL OPTI-MEM

   In a polypropylene tube, add OPTI-MEM first. Pipette FuGENE® directly into the
   OPTI-MEM – do not allow FuGENE® to come in contact with the walls of the tube
   before it has been diluted. Mix by swirling or gently flicking the tube.
   Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature.

e. Add 80 μL of FuGENE® master mix to each tube from step c for a total volume of
   100 μL. Pipette master mix directly into the liquid and not onto the walls of
   the tube. Mix by swirling or gently flicking the tube.

f. Incubate for 20-30 minutes at room temperature.

g. Retrieve HEK-293T cells from incubator. The cells should be 50-80% confluent and
   in DMEM that does not contain antibiotics.

h. Without touching the sides of the dish, gently add DNA:FuGENE® mix dropwise to
   cells. Swirl to disperse mixture evenly. Do not pipette or swirl too vigorously,
   as you do not want to dislodge the cells from the plate.

i. Incubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO₂ for 12-15 hours.

Day 3:

j. In the morning, change the media to remove the transfection reagent. Replace with
   5 mL fresh DMEM + 10% FBS + penicillin/streptomycin. Pipette the media onto the
   side of the plate so as not to disturb the transfected cells.

k. Incubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO₂ for 24 hours.

Day 4:

l. Harvest media from cells and transfer to a polypropylene storage tube. The media
   contains your lentiviral particles. Store at 4°C.

m. Add 5 mL of fresh media containing antibiotics to the cells and incubate at 37°C,
   5% CO₂ for 24 hours.

Day 5:

n. Harvest media from cells and pool with media from Day 4. Spin media at 1,250 rpm
   for 5 minutes to pellet any HEK-293T cells that were inadvertently collected
   during harvesting.

   TIP: In lieu of centrifugation, you may filter the media through a 0.45 μm
   filter to remove the cells. Do not use a 0.2 μm filter, as this is likely to
   shear the envelope of your virus.

o. Virus may be stored at 4°C for a few days, but should be frozen at -20°C or
   -80°C for long-term storage.

   TIP: Freeze/thaw cycles decrease the efficiency of the virus, so Addgene
   recommends that you use the virus immediately or aliquot the media into smaller
   tubes to prevent multiple freeze/thaw cycles.


F. INFECTING TARGET CELLS
================================================================================

Lentiviral particles can efficiently infect a broad range of cell types, including
both dividing and non-dividing cells. Addition of puromycin will allow you to
select for cells that are stably expressing your shRNA of interest.

F.1. Recommended Materials

• Hexadimethrine bromide (polybrene)*, Sigma-Aldrich: #H9268
• Protamine Sulfate*, MP Biomedicals: #194729
• Puromycin*, Sigma-Aldrich: #P8833
• Target cells (varies based on your experiment)
• Culture media for target cells (varies based on your experiment)
• Materials for assay (varies based on your experiment)

Detailed protocols for preparing polybrene, protamine sulfate, and puromycin are
located in the "Appendix".

F.2. Determining the Optimal Puromycin Concentration

Each cell line responds differently to puromycin selection. Addgene strongly
recommends that you determine the optimal puromycin concentration for your cell
line before initiating your experiment.

Day 1:

a. Plate target cells in ten 6 cm plates and grow at 37°C, 5% CO₂ overnight.

Day 2:

b. The target cells should be approximately 80-90% confluent.

c. Dilute puromycin in the preferred culture media for your target cells. The final
   concentration of puromycin should be from 1-10 μg/mL in 1 μg/mL increments.

d. Label plates from 1-10 and add appropriate puromycin-containing media to cells.

Days 3+:

e. Examine cells each day and change to fresh puromycin-containing media every
   other day.

f. The minimum concentration of puromycin that results in complete cell death after
   3-5 days is the concentration that should be used for selection in your
   experiments. (You may wish to repeat this titration with finer increments of
   puromycin to determine a more precise optimal puromycin concentration.)

F.3. Protocol for Lentiviral Infection and Selection

Day 1:

a. Plate target cells and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO₂ overnight.

Day 2:

b. Target cells should be approximately 70% confluent. Change to fresh culture
   media containing 8 μg/mL polybrene.

   TIP: Polybrene increases the efficiency of viral infection. However, polybrene
   is toxic to some cell lines. In these cell lines, substitute protamine sulfate
   for polybrene.

c. Add lentiviral particle solution from step E. For a 6 cm target plate, add
   between 0.5–1 mL virus (add 0.5 mL for a high MOI, and 0.1 mL for a low MOI).
   Scale the amount of virus added depending on the size of your target plate.

   TIP: MOI (multiplicity of infection) refers to the number of infecting viral
   particles per cell. Addgene recommends that you test a range of MOIs to
   determine the optimal MOI for infection and gene silencing in your target cell
   line.

d. Incubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO₂ overnight.

Day 3:

e. Change to fresh media 24 hours after infection.

   TIP: If viral toxicity is observed in your cell line, you may decrease the
   infection time to between 4 – 20 hours. Remove the virus-containing media and
   replace with fresh media. Do not add puromycin until at least 24 hours after
   infection to allow for sufficient expression of the puromycin resistance gene.

f. To select for infected cells, add puromycin to the media at the concentration
   determined in step F.2.

   Addgene recommends that you maintain one uninfected plate of cells in parallel.
   This plate will serve as a positive control for the puromycin selection.

Days 4+:

g. Change to fresh puromycin-containing media as needed every few days.

h. Assay infected cells. The following recommendations are guidelines for the
   number of days you should wait until harvesting your cells. However, you should
   optimize the time based on your cell line and assay:

   Assay                    | Days post-infection
   ------------------------|--------------------
   mRNA knockdown          | ≥3 days
   (quantitative PCR)      |
   Protein knockdown      | ≥4 days
   (western blot)         |
   Phenotypic assay       | ≥4 days


G. SAFETY
================================================================================

BL2 safety practices should be followed when preparing and handling lentiviral
particles. Personal protective clothing should be worn at all times. Use plastic
pipettes in place of glass pipettes or needles. Liquid waste should be
decontaminated with at least 10% bleach. Laboratory materials that come in contact
with viral particles should be treated as biohazardous waste and autoclaved.
Please follow all safety guidelines from your institution and from the CDC and NIH
for work in a BL2 facility.

If you have any questions about what safety practice to follow, please contact your
institution's safety office.

For more information, please see Addgene's Biosafety Guide.
