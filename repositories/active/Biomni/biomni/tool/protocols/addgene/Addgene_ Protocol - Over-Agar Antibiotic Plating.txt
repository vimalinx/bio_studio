PROTOCOL: Over-Agar Antibiotic Plating

================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

This protocol describes methodology for plating antibiotic over-agar for the
selection of transformed E. coli. Over-agar spreading of antibiotic makes it
easy for an investigator to conveniently plate and select transformed cells
containing plasmids differing in their resistance genes, as one does not need to
prepare separate batches of antibiotic-containing agar. This protocol will focus
specifically on selection with carbenicillin; however it can be adapted for any
antibiotic through the use of a selection curve to determine optimal antibiotic
concentration.

EQUIPMENT
================================================================================

• Pipette tips for both pipetting and spreading
• Bunsen burner (or other small flame source)
• Incubator


REAGENTS
================================================================================

• 6 cm diameter LB/agar plates without antibiotic
• High concentration (100 mg/mL, 1000x) carbenicillin stock solution in sterile
  water (or other antibiotic)
• E. coli transformed with a plasmid containing the carbenicillin (amp) resistance
  gene (or other antibiotic resistance)


PROCEDURE
================================================================================

Day 1

1. Prepare carbenicillin to a concentration of 1 mg/mL – 4 mg/mL in LB medium.

   The concentration of antibiotic required for effective over-agar selection has
   been empirically determined. See selection curve below.

   Carbenicillin is used here in place of ampicillin because carbenicillin is more
   stable, so it is potentially more effective at selecting only bacteria containing
   the plasmids of interest (for example, fewer satellite colonies will grow). It
   is, however, more expensive.

2. With a 6 cm diameter petri plate containing solidified LB-agar, pipette 150 µL
   of carbenicillin on top of the agar and gently spread over the surface until the
   liquid is mostly absorbed (there is a very small visible volume of pooled liquid
   remaining on the surface).

   We use the micropipette tip itself to do the spreading; the tip is gently bent
   to create an "L" shape, and then used like a cell spreader. Several other
   devices may be used for this purpose, provided that they fit your petri plate.

3. Incubate the plate at room temperature for at least 30 minutes with the lid on
   to give the antibiotic time to more fully absorb.

4. During the incubation, transform DH5α E. coli cells by heatshock with the
   plasmid of interest. See our transformation page for a detailed heatshock
   transformation protocol.

5. Plate 50 µL of transformed E. coli/rescue media suspension onto the agar and
   gently spread over the surface until the liquid is mostly absorbed.

   The spreading of cells can be done in the same way as the antibiotic, using
   either a bent micropipette tip or other cell spreading device that fits the
   plate.

6. Incubate plates at 37 ℃ for 18 hours.

Day 2

7. Observe plates for colony formation. Shown below are the results from an
   experiment optimizing the concentration of carbenicillin, plated over-agar for
   selection of transformed E. coli.


SAMPLE DATA
================================================================================

Selection of E.coli on LB-agar using different concentrations of carbenicillin
plated over-agar.

Control Plate with No Carbenicillin:
Plate shows a lawn of E. coli and no selection.

150 µL of 0.1 mg/mL Carbenicillin plated over-agar:
Plate shows a lawn of E. coli and no apparent selection.

150 µL of 1 mg/mL Carbenicillin plated over-agar:
Plate shows several individual colonies and effective selection.

150 µL of 2 mg/mL Carbenicillin plated over-agar:
Plate shows less individual colonies than the 1 mg/mL plate and effective selection.

150 µL of 4 mg/mL Carbenicillin plated over-agar:
Plate shows several individual colonies with smaller size than the 1 mg/mL and 2
mg/mL plates and effective selection.

Selection Curve of Transformed E. coli after Over-Agar Plating of Carbenicillin.

The above graph displays the stock concentration of Carbenicillin stock used (150
µL per plate). Please note we have found that there is generally a broad range of
antibiotic concentrations that will work for this assay, and the above result
represents a single experiment. For publishable data, the experiment would need to
be repeated to account for variability.
