PROTOCOL: Weighing Reagents Protocol

================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

For many experiments, you'll need to make buffers, media, or other solutions. A key
part of this task is making sure you're weighing all reagents precisely to create
the solution you expect. Understanding how to obtain the correct amounts of materials
for an experiment or reagents for a stock mixture is an essential laboratory
technique, as imprecise measurements can affect the outcome of your experiment. In
this protocol, you will learn the basics of how to weigh reagents. Wear the
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) prior to handling the materials.


EQUIPMENT
================================================================================

• Weighing boats or weighing paper
• Balance
• Scoopula or spatula
• Container (beaker, tube, flask, etc.)


REAGENTS
================================================================================

• Material that will be weighed out


PROCEDURE
================================================================================

The balance in the photo above has a capacity of 200 g, as indicated by the number
above the "Zero" button.

1. Before weighing out your reagents, determine the amount that you need to weigh.

2. Gather the reagent you will be weighing out, a weighing boat or weighing paper
   to contain the reagent while on the balance, and an appropriately sized container
   to put the reagent in. For some reagents, you might need to weigh it out in the
   fume hood to prevent exposure. Read the reagent's material safety data sheet
   (MSDS) to determine if this is best.

3. Check that the balance has the correct capacity for the material that you are
   weighing by looking for a weight range on the scale. Make sure that the weight
   of the material you're weighing out is within this range. If you need less than
   a gram of material, use an analytical scale. This will provide more accuracy as
   these types of scales display more decimal places.

   💡 PRO TIP: If you're weighing out an amount larger than the capacity of your
   balance or weighing boat, you can weigh out the reagents in batches. For
   example, if you need 300 g of sucrose, you can weigh out 100 g three times,
   placing the sucrose in your container after each time.

4. Place the weighing boat or weighing paper onto the balance. These are used to
   contain the material you're weighing and prevent cross-contamination with other
   substances. They also help you transfer the material to your tube or container.

   💡 PRO TIP: If you're using weighing paper, fold it in half first to create a
   crease and then place it unfolded onto the balance. This will help you remove it
   from the scale later on as otherwise, the paper could stick to the surface.

5. Tare the weighing boat or paper. You need to do this because you don't want to
   include the weight of the weighing boat or paper into your measurement. Hit the
   tare button (or zero button) to set the balance to zero.

   💡 PRO TIP: If you're weighing a minute amount of reagent that will be
   resuspended in a small volume (e.g. 0.02 g to resuspend in 1 mL), you may place
   a microcentrifuge tube on the balance and then tare it. Then add the material
   directly to the tube to weigh it.

6. Make sure that your scoopula or spatula is clean, and sterile (if necessary),
   to prevent any potential contamination.

7. Scoop out the material you are weighing onto the weighing boat or paper. If you
   weighed out too much material, don't put any extra back into the original
   container. Dispose of the excess material into an appropriate waste container if
   the material is biohazardous. Check your lab's material safety data sheets
   (MSDS) to understand how to properly dispose of reagents that you are working
   with.

   💡 PRO TIP: When you weigh out a reagent, you may leave trace amounts of it on
   the balance. Therefore, it's best to clean the balance before adding your next
   weighing boat for the next reagent.

8. Once you've weighed out the correct amount of your reagent, transfer it into
   your container.

9. Make sure that any spills produced during the protocol are cleaned up. Discard
   the weighing boat or weighing paper in the trash if the material weighed is not
   biohazardous. If it is biohazardous, discard the weighing boat or paper in the
   biohazard solid waste container.


CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Appropriately weighing reagents is important to ensure the accurate composition of
your solutions and buffers. Now that you have your reagents weighed out, you can
begin making your solutions!
