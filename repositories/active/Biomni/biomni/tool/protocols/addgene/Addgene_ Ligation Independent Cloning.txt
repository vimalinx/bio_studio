================================================================================

OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Ligation Independent Cloning (LIC) obviates the need for the time-consuming
ligation step of traditional cloning methods. In traditional cloning,
base-pairing in the short overlapping regions (usually 4 bp) does not provide
enough stability to hold the plasmid together through the
transformation/replication process. LIC employs long overhangs to form a stable
association between fragments, allowing for transformation without ligation.
Because of its dual polymerase/exonuclease functions, T4 DNA polymerase can
create overhangs of varying length (typically 10-12 bp) based on a specific
sequence. The annealed but nicked vector product is then repaired during the
replication cycle.

Empty vectors for LIC typically employ type II restriction enzymes (e.g. BsaI),
which cut at a specified distance from their recognition sequence. This can
create multiple distinct overhangs with a single enzyme, and remove the restriction
sites from the final product (no "cloning scars"). A "stuffer" sequence allows
for electrophoretic separation of linearized vector from the reaction mixture, and
may provide counter-selection for negative clones as in the example shown here. The
manufacturer of an LIC-specific vector will provide the homologous sequence which
must be built into the 5' end of the respective primers. Below we use
pNIC28-Bsa4 as an example of LIC experimental design.


PROTOCOL
================================================================================

Step 1: Design Your Primers

Primer design for LIC is often as simple as using the backbone manufacturer's
suggested leader sequence fused to your gene of interest, in frame with the
start codon or tag sequences (where appropriate). The primer length is dependent
on the T4 Pol "chew back" reaction, in which a single dNTP is included to stop
the exonuclease function of the enzyme and shift its activity back to polymerase.
In our case, dGTP will be used in the reaction, meaning that T4 Pol will remove
bases from the 3' end of the cut site until the first G is reached (shown in
blue), at which point it will add back the G and become stalled. Therefore, the
primer must begin with the following T, so that there are no gaps in the final
assembly. In this case, 15 bp of homologous sequence is used, plus a minimum of
18 bp of your template sequence. 5' and 3' primers will have different leader
sequences, but operate on the same principle (homologous to the first G on 3'-5'
strand from cut site). For simplicity, only the 5' primer is shown here.

Note: Use web-based primer design software to ensure a melting temperature
between 50-60°C for your PCR primers.

Step 2: Linearize Vector

In this example, the vector is cut at two points by the enzyme BsaI, removing the
stuffer sequence and sacB counter-selection marker (see our restriction digest
protocol). After the digest is complete, you will need to separate the
linearized vector from the reaction mixture by gel electrophoresis followed by
gel purification. The cut vector end will now look like this:

Note: Elute your purified digestion and PCR products with sterile water (instead
of TE buffer) to ensure optimal salt concentrations in subsequent reactions.

Step 3: Create Vector Overhangs

Treat the linearized vector with T4 DNA polymerase to "chew back" the free 3'
ends, following the manufacturer's instructions. In this case, we will include
the free nucleotide dGTP in the reaction (exclude all other nucleotides from
standard polymerase protocol), causing the enzyme to perform exonuclease activity
until the first "G" in the sequence. Because the polymerase reaction is favored
over the exonuclease reaction, the polymerase will add back the guanosine residue
and become stalled. A typical T4 Pol reaction is shown. Mix the components (add
the T4 last) and incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes. Inactivate T4 Pol
by heating to 75° for 20 minutes.

T4 DNA Polymerase Reaction:

Volume (μl) | Reagent              | Final Conc.
------------|----------------------|------------
4           | 10X Buffer           | 1X
20-30       | Eluted DNA           | 10-50 ng/μl
1           | dGTP (100mM)         | 2.5 mM
2           | DTT (100 mM)         | 5 mM
1           | BSA (10 μg/μl)       | 0.25 μg/μl
1           | T4 DNA polymerase    | 0.075 units/μl
sterile dH₂O to 40 μl

Step 4: Amplify Insert by PCR

Perform PCR amplification of your insert following the instructions provided by
your polymerase manufacturer. It is very important to remove all free nucleotides
from your PCR product before proceeding, as they will interfere with the
exonuclease activity of T4 Pol in the following step. This may be accomplished
by gel purification.

Step 5: Create Insert Overhangs

Treat your purified PCR product with T4 Pol in the presence of dCTP (not dGTP),
corresponding to the first base removed by the restriction digest to create the
free 5' end of the cut vector (shown in blue here). The T4 reaction may be
stopped by heating to 75° for 20 minutes.

Step 6: Anneal and Transform

Mix your treated vector and insert at a molar ratio of 1:2 or 1:3, using between
20 and 50 ng of vector per annealing reaction. This should be done in a small
volume with no additional water (<5 μl). It is advisable to set up multiple
reactions by holding the vector concentration fixed across multiple
concentrations of insert, thereby increasing your chances of success. Set up a
vector only control with water instead of the insert. Incubate the annealing
reaction for 5 minutes at room temperature, then add 1 μl of 25 mM EDTA,
followed by another 5 minutes at room temperature. The reaction is now ready for
transformation. Use 1-2 μl of annealing reaction for each transformation,
following a standard protocol.
