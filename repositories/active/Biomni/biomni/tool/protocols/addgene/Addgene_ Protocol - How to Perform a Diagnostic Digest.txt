PROTOCOL: How to Perform a Diagnostic Digest

================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Restriction enzymes are naturally occurring bacterial endonucleases that recognize
a large range of DNA sequences. Given the variety of these enzymes and the unique
sites they recognize, restriction digests have become the most widely used method
scientists employ to selectively move a specific piece of DNA from one plasmid to
another. A diagnostic restriction enzyme digest takes advantage of the fact that
restriction enzymes cleave DNA at specific sequences called restrictions sites.
Often, the size of the plasmid insert and vector backbone are known and thus this
technique can be quickly used to verify your plasmid.

The goal of a diagnostic digest is to cut your plasmid into specific sized pieces
and analyze the resulting fragments by gel electrophoresis. The pattern of the
fragments on the gel can indicate if the plasmid contains the expected size insert.
By selecting the appropriate enzyme(s), one can either linearize a plasmid to
determine the size of the entire construct or excise some or all of an insert from
it.

Before beginning your diagnostic digest, you will need to select a restriction
enzyme or enzymes that cut your plasmid. Many DNA analysis tools, including
Addgene's Sequence Analyzer, allow you to identify which restriction sites are
present in a given sequence.

EQUIPMENT
================================================================================

• Electrophoresis chamber
• Pipetman
• Pipet tips


REAGENTS
================================================================================

• Liquid DNA aliquot of your plasmid of interest (see below for recommended
  amounts)
• Appropriate restriction enzyme (see manufacturer's instructions for proper
  amount)
• Appropriate restriction digest buffer (see manufacturer's instructions)
• Gel loading dye
• Electrophoresis buffer


VERIFYING TOTAL PLASMID SIZE -OR- INSERT AND BACKBONE SIZE
================================================================================

The simplest form of diagnostic digest is one in which you just want to verify
that the plasmid that you have is the expected size, or that it is composed of a
backbone and insert of expected sizes. This is frequently done after performing
either PCR - or restriction enzyme -based cloning to test individual clones
before use of more expensive forms of plasmid verification, such as DNA sequencing.
In the example above, digestion with enzyme RE1 will linearize the 6200bp plasmid
into one single 6200bp fragment. Alternatively, digestion with both RE1 and RE2
will result in two bands; the 1200bp insert and the 5000bp backbone.


VERIFYING PLASMID IDENTITY BY "PLASMID FINGERPRINTING"
================================================================================

Often, it will be enough to know that you have a 1,200bp insert in a 5,000bp
backbone, but there are many plasmids out there that, when digested with
restriction enzymes common to multiple cloning sites, will result in similar
sized bands, thus making this simple digest less informative. This is particularly
true if you receive a plasmid from someone in another lab, or dig one out of the
freezer and you are not 100% sure it is what you are looking for, but you have a
map and know exactly what it should be. A useful restriction enzyme based
technique for verifying plasmids like this is "plasmid fingerprinting", where you
cut the plasmid into 3-8 pieces such that all (or most) fragments are small enough
to be accurately sized on a gel and also such that they are different enough in
size to be easily resolved from each other. However, by choosing an enzyme or
enzymes that will cut your plasmid into multiple fragments, you can get a very
unique pattern that will distinguish one 5kb backbone with a 1.2kb insert from all
others.

When choosing restriction enzymes for this approach, it is often a good idea to
choose two different enzymes that will give you unique but distinct patterns so
that you get double confirmation. In the example above, digestion with either RE3
or RE4 will give a very predictable pattern of bands on the gel, but by digesting
with both and seeing both patterns you can be incredibly confident that you have
the correct plasmid.


VERIFYING INSERT ORIENTATION BY RESTRICTION DIGEST
================================================================================

If you clone an insert into a vector by a single restriction enzyme, you will need
to verify that it has be cloned in the correct orientation - this can be done by
restriction digest. Although this is never an ideal cloning strategy, sometimes it
cannot be avoided. If you do have to do so, there is no way to control which
orientation the insert is ligated into the vector backbone and therefore the only
thing left to do is identify the clone(s) in which the insert is in the correct
orientation.

In the example below we want to know how to differentiate between two clones that
differ only in the orientation of the insert. By choosing an enzyme (or enzymes)
that cuts within the insert, but significantly off center (ideally around 1/3 of
the way from one end), and also cuts in the backbone on one side of the insert,
you can get a very obvious verification of the orientation so long as the
expected products from each orientation are different sizes. Simply run the
digest products on a gel and those clones with the appropriately sized products
should have the correct orientation.
