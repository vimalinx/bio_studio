PROTOCOL: Lab Safety for Biosafety Levels One and Two
SOURCE: https://www.addgene.org/protocols/lab-safety/
================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

There are four biosafety levels. This protocol provides information for both
biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) and biosafety level 2 (BSL-2). The purpose of the four
levels is to distinguish between different types of hazards and to provide
protective measures for each level, as each level has different safety
requirements. BSL-1 is designated for those working with microbes that don't cause
disease in healthy humans, for example, non-pathogenic E. coli. BSL-2 is for labs
that work with pathogens including organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus or
Vibrio cholerae. BSL-2 includes all of the precautions needed in BSL-1, along with
additional precautions to prevent injuries, ingestion, and exposures to hazardous
materials.


EQUIPMENT
================================================================================

• Lab coat
• Close-toed shoes
• Gloves
• Eye protection or face shields
• Eye wash
• Safety shower
• Sharps container
• Biohazard waste container
• Fire blanket
• Fire extinguisher


GUIDELINES
================================================================================

BSL-1 Guidelines

Before You Work

1. Right after entering the lab, put on the proper personal protective equipment
   (PPE) and wear it the whole time you are working in the lab.

2. Do not eat, drink, chew gum, or apply makeup in the laboratory.

3. Before you start your experiment, make sure your workspace is clean and
   uncluttered. Disinfect your workspace with appropriate materials. For example,
   you may use 70% ethanol, quaternary ammonium, or bleach solutions. Ask your lab
   supervisor what is available and the appropriate contact times for each agent.
   Make sure you have enough space to work at your lab bench.

4. It's possible that while working, you may accidentally come into contact with
   hazardous materials. A sink, eyewash station, safety shower, fire blanket, and
   extinguisher are also required to be present in the room. Make sure that you
   know where these are located before you start.

5. Use the eyewash station if unwanted or biohazardous materials are splashed onto
   your face and/or get into your eyes.

6. Wash your hands before and after working in the lab.

7. Ensure that a designated chemical waste accumulation site is present, and that
   you have received hazardous waste safety training before starting the work.
   Before working with chemicals, first review their material safety data sheets
   (MSDS).

While You Work

1. Dispose of sharps in a designated sharps container. Sharps include anything that
   can pierce your skin, including, but not limited to broken glass or needles.
   Sharps containers must be thick walled, impenetrable by a needle, and must be
   able to close securely.

2. Biohazard signs should be placed in all areas containing biohazardous materials,
   including biohazardous waste. Dispose of waste that may be contaminated with
   pathogens or chemicals that present a danger to people and the environment in
   biohazard containers. Biohazardous materials are decontaminated prior to
   disposal, commonly done with an autoclave.

3. Only mechanical pipetting should be done in the laboratory. Don't mouth pipette!

4. There may be some times when you may be working with a protocol that requires
   shaking or mixing, which may produce aerosols or splashes. These procedures
   should be done underneath a hood.

5. Clean any spills immediately, and decontaminate as necessary. For large spills
   that cannot be easily cleaned, evacuate and close off the area and alert the
   chemical hygiene officer.

BSL-2 Guidelines

Remember, the BSL-1 laboratory guidelines above are expected to be followed in
addition to BSL-2 guidelines below, including PPE protocols.

1. Working in a BSL-2 laboratory requires laboratory glasses in addition to coat
   and gloves. This lab coat should not be worn outside of the BSL-2 area.

2. BSL-2 laboratories must be clearly marked as "BSL-2." The names and contact
   information of the laboratory manager should be clearly visible in the room and
   on the door.

3. BSL-2 centrifugation steps require an aerosol-tight lid and rotors should be
   loaded and unloaded in a biosafety cabinet.

4. BSL-2 safety protocols require bloodborne pathogens training. It is strongly
   recommended that anyone participating in BSL-2 work receives a hepatitis B
   vaccination or titer prior to starting work in the laboratory.

5. For some biohazardous waste, an autoclave or other method for decontaminating
   must be used for proper disposal. Liquid BSL-2 waste can be decontaminated in
   a final concentration of 10% bleach for 30 minutes before pouring down the
   drain. Solid BSL-2 waste can be collected in designated biohazardous waste
   containers that can be autoclaved.


CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Although simple, following appropriate BSL-1 and BSL-2 protocol goes a long way.
It is the easiest way to ensure that you're doing your work in the safest way
possible. Protecting yourself and working smart in the lab is important!
