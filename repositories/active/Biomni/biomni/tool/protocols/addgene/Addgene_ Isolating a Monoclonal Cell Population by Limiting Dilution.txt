PROTOCOL: Isolating a Monoclonal Cell Population by Limiting Dilution
SOURCE: https://www.addgene.org/protocols/limiting-dilution/
================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

This protocol describes how to generate a monoclonal cell line from a polyclonal
pool of stable cells.

Transducing cells with lentivirus results in a heterogenous polyclonal population
that varies in the number of integration events and the site(s) of proviral
integration across cells. Selective pressure on this heterogeneous cell pool
could lead to reduced transgene expression over time, as the lower expressing
clones take over the polyclonal cell pool. Generating a monoclonal cell line by
limiting dilution results in cell populations that are more likely to retain
stable transgene expression. Other methods of generating a monoclonal cell line
include single-cell sorting or isolating individual cells with cloning cylinders.

with lentivirus.

💡 PRO TIP: Because the polyclonal cell pool is always undergoing selection, it's
best to generate monoclonal cell lines from the polyclonal pool as early as
possible, though in theory a monoclonal line could be generated at any time.


CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE YOU START
================================================================================

• Some cell lines tend not to grow well in sparse/individual cultures due to
  lack of secreted growth factors, so not every cell type will be able to grow
  under the conditions described in this protocol.

• Conditioned medium (details below) can be used to enhance the growth of cells
  in individual cultures. Other methods for enhancing single cell growth, such
  as using culture medium with increased serum concentrations, may be optimal for
  different cell types.

• Before starting this procedure, be sure that the cell pool has been
  sufficiently selected with the appropriate antibiotic so that every cell in
  the culture has, in theory, been transduced. There are various schools of
  thought on using selective medium throughout subsequent experiments. When
  selective medium is used, it may have additional biological effects on the cell
  line. In the absence of selective medium, there is a chance that the integrated
  transgene could be lost through recombination. Some researchers choose to
  maintain cells in selective medium at a reduced antibiotic concentration (e.g.,
  half the concentration that was used for the initial selection). Addgene
  recommends that the use of selective medium throughout experiments be determined
  empirically, and that the cell population be monitored regularly for transgene
  expression.

• This protocol has been optimized for adherent cells but can be modified for
  suspension cells.

• The number of monoclonal lines generated using this protocol will vary based
  on several factors, including the growth properties of the cell lines, the
  effects of the transgene, and the specific conditions used. Each 96-well plate
  described in this protocol could, in theory, give rise to a maximum of 48
  monoclonal cell lines. When this protocol was performed at Addgene on the A549
  cells described in our sample data, each 96-well plate gave rise to 15–20
  monoclonal lines.


PROCEDURE
================================================================================

Generating Conditioned Medium (optional)

1. Seed stable cells such that the next day they will be approximately 50–60%
   confluent. For 293T cells this is about 2 × 10⁶ cells in a 10 cm dish. Each
   10 cm dish should be seeded in 10 mL DMEM complete, which will generate enough
   conditioned medium for one 96-well plate.

2. Allow the cells to grow overnight.

3. Replace the medium on the cells and collect the used (conditioned) media.

4. Remove any cells from the conditioned medium by filtration through a 0.45 µm
   PES filter or centrifugation at >500 x g for 5 minutes. Do not use the medium
   if the cells are overly confluent or the medium is acidified (i.e., the medium
   appears orange/yellow if using a standard phenol red pH indicator) because the
   buildup of waste products could be suboptimal for cell growth. This conditioned
   medium will be used to make a cell solution later in this protocol.

Isolating a Monoclonal Cell Population by Limiting Dilution

1. Isolate cells from the stable cell pool by trypsinization and break up any
   cell clumps into individual cells by passing several times through a
   serological pipet or by passing through a 40 µm cell strainer mesh. Count the
   cell concentration in this homogenized cell solution using a hemocytometer or
   other cell counter.

   💡 PRO TIP: Prepare a relatively dilute cell solution (<10⁶ cells/mL) before
   counting the cells. When you ultimately transfer approximately 50–100 cells to
   the conditioned medium, it will be more accurate if a higher volume of
   homogenized cell solution is transferred.

2. Transfer cells from the homogenized cell solution into the conditioned medium
   prepared above to make a new cell solution at a concentration of 5 cells/mL.
   Prepare approximately 10 mL of this cell solution for each 96-well plate you
   plan to seed. If you choose not to use conditioned medium, prepare this cell
   solution in fresh complete medium. This 5 cells/mL solution will be used to
   seed the 96-well plate.

   Sample Calculation:
   • First, use a hemocytometer to quantitate the homogenized cell solution.
   • Homogenized cell solution concentration: 4 × 10⁵ cells/mL
   • To seed one 96-well plate, make 10 mL of a 5 cell/mL solution. Calculate
     the total cells needed: 10 mL × 5 cells/mL = 50 cells
   • Determine the volume of homogenized cell solution that corresponds to 50
     cells: (50 cells)/(4 × 10⁵ cells/mL) = 0.125 µL
   • Because this is such a small volume, first make 1 mL of a 1:100 dilution of
     the homogenized cell solution by adding 10 µL homogenized cell solution to
     990 µL complete medium. Instead of transferring 0.125 µL, now transfer 100
     times that volume, which is 12.5 µL.
   • To make the final 5 cell/mL solution, transfer 12.5 µL of the 1:100 dilution
     to 10 mL of conditioned medium.

3. Transfer 100 µL of the 5 cells/mL solution into each well of a 96-well plate.
   By doing this, you are seeding the plate at an average density of 0.5
   cells/well. Seeding an average of 0.5 cells/well ensures that some wells
   receive a single cell, while minimizing the likelihood that any well receives
   more than one cell.

   💡 PRO TIP: In each 96-well plate, seed one of the corner wells with ~1000
   cells. This will help you focus the microscope later when scanning the plate
   for individual cells, which can be difficult to find.

4. Leave the cells undisturbed in an incubator for 7–14 days. After ~7 days, scan
   the plate for cell growth. If you do not observe any colonies, continue
   incubating the cells.

   💡 PRO TIP: Use the well with 1000 cells to focus the microscope, then you can
   easily scan the plate for individual cells, which should be on the same focal
   plane.

5. Scan the entire plate and make note of each well in which you see growth. At
   this time, the cells will appear as colonies in the well (Figure 1). You will
   be able to tell if there was more than a single cell seeded in a well because
   you will observe more than one colony. Wells with more than a single colony do
   not contain a monoclonal population and should be discarded.

   💡 PRO TIP: When scanning the plate, be sure to look thoroughly within each
   well, especially in the corner of the well as cells tend to settle there.

6. Once the cells have expanded but before they become over-confluent, trypsinize
   the cells and expand them to larger culture dishes, being sure not to cross
   contaminate the independent monoclonal lines.

   💡 PRO TIP: When trypsinizing cells from the 96-well plate, use a microscope
   to ensure that the cells have detached from the plate and can be isolated.
   When trypsinized, detached cells will exhibit a rounded morphology.

7. After the monoclonal lines have been sufficiently expanded, screen the lines
   for transgene expression and/or other phenotypes. For example, perform Western
   blotting to screen for lines with the highest or lowest transgene expression
   (Figure 2).


SAMPLE DATA
================================================================================

Generation of monoclonal cell lines from expansion of individual A549 cells
stably expressing Cas9. A549 cells were transduced with lentiCas9-Blast and then
selected with 1 μg/mL blasticidin for 9 days. Single cells were then plated in
individual wells of a 96-well plate and left undisturbed for 13 days. Colonies
formed in individual wells of a 96-well plate after expansion of single cells for
13 days. Note that growth rate differences can be inferred by the differences in
colony size.

Cas9 expression in monoclonal cell lines generated from A549 cells transduced with
lentiCas9-Blast. A549 cells were transduced (MOI = 37) and selected with 1 μg/mL
blasticidin for 9 days. Single cells from a stable cell pool were then expanded
for an additional 3 weeks under blasticidin selection. Anti-Cas9 Western blotting
was performed on whole-cell extracts from the initial stable cell pool (pool) and
from individual cell expansions (monoclonal, 1-5). Wild-type A549 cells do not
express Cas9 and are included as a control (WT). Vinculin is a loading control.
