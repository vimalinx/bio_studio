================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

This protocol can be used to purify AAV of any serotype.

In medicine, iodixanol can be used as an intravenous isomolar contrast agent. In
research, iodixanol is used as an isomolar density gradient medium suitable for
virus purification and isolation of cells, organelles, lipoproteins, and
macromolecules. Importantly, iodixanol is inert and non-toxic to mammalian cells.
Therefore, and unlike other density gradient media, it is reportedly not
necessary to remove iodixanol prior to use of your purified virus. Nonetheless,
we recommend performing a buffer exchange before using the purified AAV in vivo.

The iodixanol gradient in this protocol is composed of steps that separate out
contaminants from an impure AAV preparation. The 15% iodixanol step has 1M NaCl to
destabilize ionic interactions between macromolecules. The 40% and 25% steps are
used to remove contaminants with lower densities, including empty capsids. The 60%
step serves as a cushion for genome-containing virions. Phenol red is added to
clearly distinguish the steps. This method will help enrich the prep with full
(genome containing) particles. On average, iodixanol-purified AAV preparations
contain ~20% empty particles.

60% iodixanol solution is available under the name OptiPrep from Sigma-Aldrich.

PROCEDURE
================================================================================

Preparation and loading of the iodixanol gradient:

1. Prepare the gradient steps:
   • 15% iodixanol step: mix 4.5 mL of 60% iodixanol and 13.5 mL of 1 M
     NaCl/PBS-MK buffer
   • 25% iodixanol step: mix 5 mL of 60% iodixanol and 7 mL of 1X PBS-MK buffer
     and 30 μL of phenol red
   • 40% iodixanol step: mix 6.7 mL of 60% iodixanol and 3.3 mL of 1X PBS-MK
     buffer
   • 60% iodixanol step: mix 10 mL of 60% iodixanol and 45 μL of phenol red

2. Underlay each solution into a QuickSeal tube in the order below using a 10 mL
   syringe and a blunt edge 18 ga Hamilton needle, taking care to avoid bubbles:
   • 8 mL of 15% iodixanol step
   • 5 mL of 25% iodixanol step
   • 5 mL of 40% iodixanol step
   • 3 mL of 60% iodixanol step

3. Carefully add up to 5 mL of clarified supernatant on top of the gradient. Use
   1X PBS (or formulation buffer) to top off the tube.

4. Seal the QuickSeal tubes.

5. Centrifuge at 350,000 x g for 90 min in a T70i rotor at 10 °C.

   💡 PRO TIP: If you need more time, you can alternatively centrifuge for 2 h at
   200,000 x g at 18 °C.

6. Carefully take the QuickSeal tubes out of the rotor and place them in a stable
   rack.

   **Make sure not to disturb the gradient!**

Collect Fractions

Option #1:

1. Prepare a row of roughly 20 open 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes in a rack.
   These will be used to collect fractions from the gradient. You can collect fewer
   fractions once you have a good idea when the virus elutes from the gradients.

2. In a biosafety cabinet, carefully puncture the QuickSeal tube at the interface
   of the 60% and 40% gradient (see Figure 2) with an 18 ga needle.

3. Place the first microcentrifuge tube under the needle's opening to collect the
   fractions.

4. Puncture the top of the QuickSeal tube with a 16 ga needle and start
   collecting 0.5 mL to 1 mL fractions per tube.

5. Avoid the proteinaceous material near the 40–25% interface.

   💡 PRO TIP: As soon as the top of the tube is punctured, AAV-containing
   Iodixanol solution will flow from the needle set at the 40–60% interface.
   Make sure that the microcentrifuge tubes are well positioned to collect the
   solution, or you will lose a significant amount of your virus. When the first
   fraction is collected, move the rack to the next empty tube to collect the next
   fraction. The flow will be rapid at first and will progressively slow down.

Option #2:

1. Puncture the QuickSeal tube at the bottom using an 18 ga needle.

2. Immediately start collecting 0.5 to 1 mL fractions in microcentrifuge tubes.

3. Repeat for each QuickSeal tube.

4. The first 3 mL collected corresponds to the 60% phase and can be discarded.

5. The fractions obtained from the 40% phase contain the purified AAV.

Option #3:

1. Puncture the QuickSeal tube slightly below the 60–40% interface with an 18 ga
   needle attached to a 10 mL syringe.

2. The bevel of the needle should be up, facing the 40% step.

3. Collect up to 5 mL per tube, taking care to avoid collecting the
   proteinaceous material at the 40–25% interface.

4. Repeat for each QuickSeal tube.

5. (Optional) For first time users, it is a good idea to assay each fraction by
   silver stain or SYPRO Ruby stain to determine purity. Only the cleanest
   fractions should be kept and pooled for dialysis.

6. Pool clean fractions.

Concentration and buffer exchange:

Stocks of Poloxamer 188:
• Poloxamer 188, 10% solution
• A: 0.1% in PBS: 49.5 mL PBS + 500 µl Poloxamer 188
• B: 0.01% in PBS: 45 mL PBS + 5 ml A
• C: 0.001% in PBS: 45 mL PBS + 5 ml B + 200 mM NaCl

Procedure:

1. Cover the filter membrane with 15 mL of 0.1% Poloxamer 188 PBS and incubate
   for 10 min at RT

2. Spin at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the flow through.

3. Add 15 mL of 0.01% Poloxamer 188 PBS and incubate for 10 min at RT.

4. Spin at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the flow through.

5. Add 15 mL of 0.001% Poloxamer 188 + 200mM NaCl PBS.

6. Spin at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the flow through.

7. Add your sample.

8. Spin at 3500 rpm for 5–8 min at 4 °C, discard the flow through.

9. Add more sample and spin 3500 rpm for 2–5 min at 4 °C, discard the flow
   through.

10. Repeat this step as needed.

    Please note that iodixanol is not easily removed. After each spin, add more
    formulation buffer and sample and make sure to pipet back and forth a few
    times to mix the iodixanol that has settled at the bottom of the column.

11. We recommend concentrating to a minimum of 500 µL. If the concentrate volume
    is less than 500 µL, bring up the volume with formulation buffer.

12. Use a P1000 to the bottom of the filter and pipette up/down and wash off the
    walls of the filter to recover as much virus as possible.

13. Store at 4 °C for short term (2 weeks), or aliquot and store at -80 °C for
    long term.
