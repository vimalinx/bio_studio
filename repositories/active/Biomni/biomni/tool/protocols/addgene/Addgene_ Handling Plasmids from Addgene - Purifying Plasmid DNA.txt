SOURCE: https://www.addgene.org/protocols/purify-plasmid-dna/
================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Many molecular biology techniques require highly purified and concentrated plasmid
DNA. This page will discuss the general procedure for purifying plasmid DNA from
bacterial culture. For details on how to streak a plate to get individual
colonies and to generate liquid bacterial cultures, please see those pages.

Several companies, such as NEB, Qiagen, Invitrogen, and Promega sell kits for
isolating plasmid DNA in quantities as low as a few micrograms to as much as
several milligrams and at concentrations ranging from 150 ng/μL to several μg/μL.
The protocol below is meant to describe the general procedure for purifying
plasmid DNA from bacterial cultures. If you will be using a kit, follow the kit's
instructions. If you want to perform plasmid purification without using a kit,
you can find a protocol for kit-free plasmid mini-prep at the bottom of this page.

• Overnight culture of bacteria transformed with your plasmid
• Resuspension buffer
• Denaturing solution
• Renaturing solution
• 2 mg/mL RNase A
• TE or water-saturated phenol-chloroform
• Chloroform

PROTOCOL: GENERALIZED DNA PURIFICATION
================================================================================

1. Grow an overnight culture of bacteria.

   💡 PRO TIP: Refer to appropriate DNA prep protocol for volume of bacteria to
   grow (low copy plasmids require larger cultures).

2. Centrifuge the culture to pellet the bacteria before proceeding with DNA
   preparation.

   💡 PRO TIP: If your entire overnight culture cannot fit into a single
   centrifuge tube, aliquot it into several tubes/bottles.

3. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the bacteria in buffer.

   Note: This step gets all of the bacteria back into suspension, but within a
   smaller volume of buffer that is compatible with the next solution.

4. Add a denaturing solution to the resuspended bacteria.

   Note: This step causes the bacteria to lyse, releasing their contents,
   including plasmid DNA, into solution.

5. Add a renaturing solution to the denatured bacteria.

   Note: This step brings the pH back down causing the proteins and genomic DNA
   to precipitate, while leaving the smaller plasmids free in solution.

6. Pellet the proteins and genomic DNA by centrifugation, and remove the
   plasmid-containing supernatant.

7. Add either ethanol or isopropanol to precipitate the plasmid DNA.

8. Either spin to pellet the DNA or apply the solution to a column that will bind
   the now precipitated DNA.

9. Wash the pellet or column with 70% ethanol to remove excess salt.

10. Resuspend the DNA pellet, or elute the DNA off of the column using water or a
    neutral buffer such as TE.

You will now have plasmid DNA that has been purified away from the bacterial
proteins and genomic DNA. Depending on the method used, the DNA concentration and
purity will vary. For more information on determining DNA concentration and purity

PROTOCOL: KIT-FREE ALKALINE LYSIS PLASMID MINIPREP
================================================================================

Prepare the following solutions:

Solution I - Resuspension Buffer:
• 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8)
• 50 mM glucose
• 10 mM EDTA
• Store Solution I at 4°C

Solution II - Denaturing Solution:
• 0.2 N NaOH
• 1.0% SDS
• Store Solution II at room temperature

Solution III - Renaturing Solution (Potassium Acetate):
• 120 mL 5M Potassium acetate
• 23 mL glacial acetic acid
• 57 mL of dH₂O
• Store Solution III at 4°C

Procedure:

1. Grow 2 mL overnight cultures from single colonies of bacteria containing your
   plasmid of interest.

2. Add 1.5 mL of the stock culture to a 1.75 mL microfuge tube.

3. Centrifuge in microfuge tube at 10,000 g for 30 sec.

4. Pour off the supernatant, being careful not to disturb the bacterial pellet.

5. Resuspend the pellet in 100 μL of cold Solution I.

6. Vortex the solution for 2 min or until all bacteria are fully resuspended.

7. Add 200 μL of Solution II and invert the tube carefully 5 times to mix the
   contents. The contents will become clear and thicker as the proteins and DNA
   are denatured.

   💡 PRO TIP: Do not vortex at this stage or the genomic DNA will become sheared
   and will therefore contaminate your purified plasmid DNA.

8. Incubate solution on ice for 5 min.

9. Add 150 μL of cold Solution III to each tube.

10. Mix by inverting several times. A white precipitate will be formed which
    contains the bacterial proteins and genomic DNA.

11. Incubate tube on ice for 5 min.

12. Centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 12,000 g.

    Notes:
    • Pellet contains proteins, cell fragments, salt and other extra particles
      from solutions.
    • Supernatant contains the plasmid DNA separated from bacterial chromosomes.

13. Collect the supernatant into a new tube by pipetting or carefully pouring.

14. Optional: Add 5 μL of 2 mg/mL RNase A to the supernatant in the new tube and
    incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.

    Note: Ribonuclease A (RNase A) is a pancreatic ribonuclease that digests
    single-stranded RNA.

15. Optional: Perform phenol-chloroform extraction - see protocol below.

    Note: Phenol-chloroform extraction removes remaining contaminant proteins and
    RNase A from the DNA sample. When phenol is mixed with the aqueous solution
    containing DNA, proteins will move into the phenol phase and will be
    separated from the aqueous DNA.

16. Add either 700 μL of cold 100% ethanol or 350 μL room temperature isopropanol
    to the solution to precipitate the plasmid DNA; see detailed protocol below.

    💡 PRO TIP: If precipitating with ethanol, it is often thought that an
    incubation of 20 min to overnight at -20 °C or -80 °C will improve
    precipitation.

17. Pour out the supernatant.

18. Optional: Wash the pellet with 70% ethanol.

    Note: This step removes excess salt from the pellet which can cause problems
    with some common reactions.

19. Air dry the pellet (can be done by inverting the tube at an angle over
    kimwipe) for 20-30 min.

20. Resuspend pellet with 25-50 μL of TE.


PROTOCOL: PHENOL-CHLOROFORM EXTRACTION OF DNA SAMPLES
================================================================================

1. Add an equal volume of TE-saturated phenol-chloroform to the aqueous DNA
   sample.

   💡 PRO TIP: Water-saturated phenol-chloroform can be used if TE-saturated is
   not available.

2. Vortex microfuge tube for 30-60 sec.

3. Centrifuge the tube for 5 min at room temperature on the highest setting.

   Note: You should see clearly separated layers:
   • Top Phase - Aqueous DNA phase
   • Middle phase - A white layer may appear, consisting of precipitated protein
     particles
   • Bottom phase - Organic phase (protein)

4. Pipet the aqueous DNA layer and place it in a new microfuge tube.

5. Add equal volume of chloroform to the recovered aqueous DNA layer.

6. Repeat steps 2-4.

   Note: Phenol-chloroform is a hazardous waste - DO NOT pour down sink.


PROTOCOL: ETHANOL PRECIPITATION
================================================================================

1. To your DNA solution, add 2-2.5 volumes 95% or 100% ethanol and 1/10 volume
   of 3 M Na-acetate (pH 4.8).

2. Invert the microfuge tube to mix.

3. Optional: Place the tube either at -20 °C overnight OR -80 °C for 30 min OR on
   dry ice for 5 min.

   Note: This freezing may help the DNA to precipitate.

4. Centrifuge solution at high speed (at least 12,000 rpm) for 15-30 min at 4°C.

   Notes:
   • Pellet contains the precipitated DNA.
   • Supernatant contains residues, salts, and water.

5. Pour out the supernatant in the sink.

6. Open and invert the tubes on a paper towel to drain them out.

7. Wash pellet by adding 500 µL cold 70% ethanol.

   Note: This helps to remove excess salt from the DNA pellet.

8. Centrifuge solution at high speed (at least 12,000 rpm) for 5 min at room
   temp.

9. Pour out the supernatant in the sink.

   💡 PRO TIP: Be careful, the pellet is harder to see and less well attached to
   the tube after the 70% ethanol wash. You can also pipet the supernatant out of
   the tube if you are worried about losing the pellet.

10. Dry with vacuum or by inverting over paper towel for 5-20 min.

11. Resuspend dry DNA with TE (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.1 mM EDTA).

    💡 PRO TIP: DNA resuspension can take time, it is a good idea to let it sit
    for several hours to overnight at room temperature before quantifying and
    using.

12. Store DNA at 4°C.


TIPS AND FAQ
================================================================================

• Plasmid purification kits provide the fastest way to obtain a high
  concentration of clean plasmid DNA. To improve the purity of plasmid DNA
  purified without a kit it is advisable to perform a phenol/chloroform
  extraction of the supernatant after step 6 and before step 7. This will help
  to remove proteins and other contaminants from the plasmid DNA.

• It is also advisable to add RNAse to the supernatant after step 6 to eliminate
  RNA contamination. This is included in the resuspension buffer of most kits.
