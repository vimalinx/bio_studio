PROTOCOL: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for BSL-1 and BSL-2 Labs
SOURCE: https://www.addgene.org/protocols/ppe/
================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

There are four biosafety levels. This protocol provides information for both
biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) and biosafety level 2 (BSL-2). The BSL-1 classification is
for labs working with low-risk microbes posing little to no threat of infection or
disease in healthy humans. Many of the precautions are meant to protect individuals
from potential accidents such as spills. BSL-2 is different because it includes
labs that work with agents associated with diseases in healthy humans. BSL-2
includes all of the precautions needed in BSL-1, however there are additional
precautions that lie beyond PPE.


EQUIPMENT
================================================================================

• Lab coat
• Close-toed shoes
• Gloves
• Eye protection and face shields, as needed


GUIDELINES
================================================================================

1. Your lab coat should be buttoned to protect your body and clothing from
   potential spills.

2. Gloves should fit well enough to be snug to your hand, but not so tight that
   you cannot perform your duties. Be sure to try out different sizes to know your
   fit. It is best to not reuse gloves. Dispose your gloves in a biohazard waste
   container.

3. Your lab coat and gloves should not be worn in "common areas" such as the lunch
   room, offices, and bathroom. These items should remain in the laboratory. When
   traveling between lab spaces, take your glove off of one hand and use your bare
   hand to open doors.

4. For those with latex allergies, be aware that some gloves may contain latex.
   Consider nitrile gloves as an alternative.

5. For extra precautions, tuck your sleeves into your gloves to prevent potential
   spills down your sleeve. This may or may not be possible depending on the type
   of sleeve.

6. Lastly, don't touch your face!

7. Close-toed shoes and long pants should be worn to protect your legs and feet
   from potential spills. If wearing open-toed shoes, cloth coverings or
   "booties" can be used to protect your feet.

   💡 PRO TIP: If they are able, sometimes scientists work for a long time while
   standing. Wear comfortable shoes that cushion your feet.

8. Eye protection such as goggles and/or face shields can be used as needed. For
   BSL-2 work always wear glasses/goggles in addition to the BSL-1 requirements.


CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Although simple, following appropriate PPE protocol goes a long way. It is the
easiest way to ensure that you're doing your work in the safest way possible.
Protecting yourself is important!
