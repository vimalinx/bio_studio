INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

A centrifuge is a common piece of laboratory equipment used to separate different
components in a liquid sample. It achieves this by using centrifugal force, which
is generated by spinning the sample at a high speed. Being able to separate solids
from a liquid or separate liquids of different densities is essential to many
different experimental procedures, such as minipreps and RNA extractions. Plus,
centrifuges are useful for simply collecting liquid to the bottom of a tube.

You will likely encounter several different types of centrifuges that can
accommodate different sized containers, spin at different speeds, or keep samples
at specific temperatures. This protocol will cover the general procedure and
features to keep in mind when using any centrifuge. However, each centrifuge may
have specific instructions so be sure to check in with someone familiar with your
lab's instrument before use.

• Centrifuge
• Microfuge tubes or other suitable container
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) appropriate for the biosafety level of the
  lab space

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
================================================================================

Types and Parts

There are several types of centrifuges:

• Mini or Tabletop Centrifuges: Sit on your benchtop and typically hold the
  common 1.5 mL microfuge tubes used in labs, though some larger models can hold
  larger conical tubes. Depending on the centrifuge their speed ranges can vary,
  but are typically lower than some other centrifuge types.

• Floor Centrifuges: Sit on the floor and can be about bench height. They often
  spin at similar speeds to their smaller cousins, but can hold much larger
  containers.

• Ultracentrifuges: Also generally floor sized centrifuges that can hold larger
  containers, but they can also rotate at much higher speeds and are used for
  more specialized techniques.

Regardless of the type of centrifuge you use, most will have essentially the same
components. The photo to the left shows a front view of an open tabletop
microcentrifuge with the lid open, the rotor with microfuge tubes in place, and
the control panel where you can set the time and speed needed for your experiment.


PROCEDURE
================================================================================

How to Centrifuge

Now that you know the different parts of a centrifuge, you're ready to begin using
the centrifuge.

1. Determine the type of centrifuge needed. This decision should be based on the
   size of tubes you are using and the speed at which you need to spin your
   samples. For example, spinning down samples in 1.5 mL microfuge tubes at
   10,000 rpm would require a tabletop microcentrifuge like the one in the picture
   above.

2. Wear PPE appropriate for the lab space in which you are working. Even if your
   samples may not require specific PPE, you never know what else has been placed
   in the centrifuge before you and may still be on the equipment.

3. Before using the centrifuge for your samples, ensure that the centrifuge is
   clean and that everything appears to be working smoothly.

4. Place your sample tubes into the rotor so that they are distributed evenly
   around the center (see image to right). Even distribution ensures that the
   centrifuge is balanced. Using the centrifuge in an unbalanced state can damage
   the centrifuge and be dangerous for the user. If you do not have a balanced
   number of samples, you may need to add a blank. Blanks are often an extra
   tube filled with water to the same volume as your samples. If your samples are
   significantly higher density than water, then you may need to fill the blank
   based on weight instead of volume.

   💡 PRO TIP: For microfuge tubes, place them with the lid tabs pointing up or
   out of the centrifuge so that the pellets form in approximately the same place
   in each sample.

5. Place the centrifuge's internal lid on the rotor (if it has one) and then
   close the external lid.

6. Adjust the centrifuge settings according to speed and time (and temperature, if
   applicable) listed in your protocol.

   💡 PRO TIP: Spin speed is often given as Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF) or
   Revolutions Per Minute (RPM), these are not the same units and are not
   directly interchangeable. If you need to convert between the two, use a
   conversion calculator or chart like the G Force calculator.

7. The centrifuge should come up to speed with a pleasant hum. If you hear loud
   noises or the centrifuge begins to wobble or shake, this could indicate an
   unbalanced or improperly loaded centrifuge. Immediately stop the centrifuge
   and investigate the issue.

8. When you are finished spinning your samples, carefully remove them from the
   centrifuge so as to not dislodge any pellets or re-mix liquids. In cases where
   you are separating solids from a liquid, pellets represent the solids in your
   sample while the liquid portion is known as the supernatant. Depending on your
   experiment, you may be required to save the pellet, the supernatant, or both.


CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Centrifuges are important tools for many different protocols. Improper use of a
centrifuge can damage the equipment, your samples, or you, so be sure to keep
your centrifuge clean and balanced.
