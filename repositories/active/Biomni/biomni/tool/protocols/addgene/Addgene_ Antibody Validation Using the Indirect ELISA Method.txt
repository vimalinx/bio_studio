PROTOCOL: Antibody Validation Using the Indirect ELISA Method
SOURCE: https://www.addgene.org/protocols/ab-validation-indirect-elisa/
================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

This protocol describes how to run an indirect Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay
(ELISA) against a purified antigen to validate an antibody. This protocol will
describe how to create a standard curve using known concentrations of the antigen
and how to probe with an antibody against the target to show a dose response.


GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

The ELISA can be completed in a single day or broken up over several days by
incubating certain steps at 4 °C instead of room temperature or 37 °C. The
protocol notes when there are different incubation options available.

Caution: Use the Stop Solution in a well ventilated area and avoid breathing in
the vapors.

BEFORE STARTING
================================================================================

Warm reagents to room temperature.


PROCEDURE
================================================================================

Section 1: Prepare the Antigen Standard and coat the plate

1. Dilute purified antigen to 20 ng/µL in a microfuge tube and vortex.

   💡 PRO TIP: You may need to try a few different concentrations of antigen to
   determine the ideal concentration.

2. Prepare serial dilutions of the purified antigen as follows:
   • 2 ng/µL: Add 100 µL of 20 ng/µL stock into 900 µL PBS in a microfuge tube
     and vortex.
   • 1 ng/µL: Add 450 µL of 2 ng/µL stock into 450 uL PBS in a microfuge tube and
     vortex.
   • 0.5 ng/µL: Add 450 µL of 1 ng/µL stock into 450 µL PBS in a microfuge tube
     and vortex.
   • 0.25 ng/µL: Add 450 µL of 0.5 ng/µL stock into 450 µL PBS in a microfuge tube
     and vortex.
   • 0.125 ng/µL: Add 450 µL of 0.25 ng/µL stock into 450 µL PBS in a microfuge
     tube and vortex.
   • 0 ng/µL: 450 µL PBS only.

3. Pipette 50 µL into the first three wells of each row, using a different
   standard solution for each row of a 96-well ELISA microplate.

4. Cover the plate with a 96-well plate seal and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min,
   or overnight at 4 °C.

Section 2: Block the plate

1. Prepare the wash buffer (0.05% Tween-20 in PBS) as follows:
   • Pipette 0.5 mL of Tween-20 to into 999.5 mL 1X PBS
   • Cap the bottle and invert several times to mix.

2. Carefully remove the plate seal from the 96-well plate and set aside.

3. Aspirate the wells and use a multichannel pipette to add 200 µL wash buffer to
   each well. Washing can be done by hand but if available, use an automated ELISA
   plate washer.

4. Seal the plate.

5. Place the plate on a microplate shaker set at 400 rpm and shake for 1 min.

6. Repeat steps 3–5 twice for a total of three washes.

7. After the final wash, aspirate the wash buffer from the wells.

8. Prepare the blocking buffer (1% BSA in PBS) as follows:
   • Add 250 mg of BSA to 25 mL of PBS.
   • Cap the tube and invert several times to mix.

9. Using a multichannel pipette, add 200 µL of blocking buffer to each well.

10. Cover the plate with a plate seal and incubate on a microplate shaker set to
    400 rpm for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.

Section 3: Primary antibody incubation

1. Carefully remove the plate seal from the 96-well plate and set aside.

2. Aspirate the wells and use a multichannel pipette to add 200 µL wash buffer to
   each well. Washing can be done by hand but if available, use an automated ELISA
   plate washer.

3. Seal the plate.

4. Place the plate on a microplate shaker set at 400 rpm and shake for 1 min.

5. Repeat steps 2–4 twice for a total of three washes.

6. After the final wash, aspirate the wash buffer from the wells.

7. Prepare antibody dilution buffer (0.1% BSA in PBS) as follows:
   • Dilute 50 mg BSA into 50 mL PBS.
   • Cap the tube and invert several times to mix.

8. Dilute the primary antibody and an isotype control antibody to the desired
   concentrations in the antibody dilution buffer.

   💡 PRO TIP: The ideal antibody concentration will vary and needs to be
   empirically determined. We suggest starting with three concentrations between
   1–10 µg/mL.

9. Cap and invert the tubes several times to mix.

10. Using a multichannel pipette, add 100 µL of primary antibody solution to the
    appropriate wells.

11. Cover the plate with a plate seal and incubate on a microplate shaker set to
    400 rpm for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.

Section 4: Secondary antibody incubation

1. Carefully remove the plate seal from the 96-well plate and set aside.

2. Aspirate the wells and use a multichannel pipette to add 200 µL wash buffer to
   each well. Washing can be done by hand but if available, use an automated ELISA
   plate washer.

3. Seal the plate.

4. Place the plate on a microplate shaker set at 400 rpm and shake for 1 min.

5. Repeat steps 2–4 twice for a total of three washes.

    400 rpm for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.

Section 5: TMB reaction

1. Carefully remove the plate seal from the 96-well plate and set aside.

2. Aspirate the wells and use a multichannel pipette to add 200 µL wash buffer to
   each well. Washing can be done by hand but if available, use an automated ELISA
   plate washer.

3. Seal the plate.

4. Place the plate on a microplate shaker set at 400 rpm and shake for 1 min.

5. Repeat steps 2–4 twice for a total of three washes.

6. After the final wash, aspirate the wash buffer from the wells.

7. Immediately before use, mix 5 mL TMB Solution and 5 mL Peroxide Solution from
   the TMB substrate kit.

8. Cap the tube and invert several times to mix.

9. Using a multichannel pipette, add 100 µL of the TMB/Peroxide mix to each well.

10. Cover the plate with a plate seal and wrap in foil.

11. Incubate plate at room temperature on a microplate shaker set at 400 rpm for
    15–30 min.

    💡 PRO TIP: Check the plate periodically to determine when the desired color
    change has occurred. The color will change from yellow to blue and generally
    takes between 15 to 30 min. High concentrations of HRP yield a greenish
    solution. Stop the reaction before any wells display a green product. A
    precipitated product indicates the presence of too much HRP and the need to
    optimize experimental conditions.

12. When the desired color change has occurred, gently remove the plate seal.

13. Using a multichannel pipette, add 100 µL of TMB Stop Solution directly to the
    wells to stop the reaction.

14. Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm on the spectrophotometer. Use the
    spectrophotometer to generate a standard curve. If you don't see any color
    change or dose response, your antibody concentration may have been too low. In
    this case, use higher antibody concentrations. If the reaction is saturated and
    you don't see any dose response, your antibody concentration may have been too
    high. In this case, use lower antibody concentrations. The ideal range of the
    standard curve will vary between targets and needs to be empirically determined.
    The dilution series created in section 1, step 2 is a suggested starting point.
    If your unknown sample's absorbance falls above the range of the standard curve
    you will need to either include higher concentrations in the standard curve or
    dilute the unknown sample (don't forget to factor in that dilution when
    calculating the original sample concentration!).


TIPS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

• The optimal concentration of primary antibody to use will vary and needs to be
  empirically determined. If possible, run an initial test with serially diluted
  primary antibody and determine the best concentration for your assay.

• Washing steps can be done by hand but if available, use an automated ELISA plate
  washer.


SAMPLE DATA
================================================================================

The plate was coated with serial dilutions of human recombinant purified Desmin
(blue) or a negative control protein, Apolipoprotein L3 (red) overnight,
blocked, and incubated overnight with Anti-Desmin [D7]. Plates were incubated with
HRP-linked anti-Human IgG secondary antibody for 2 hours, reacted with TMB
substrate and the reaction stopped after 15 minutes. Absorbance was read at 450 nm
and plotted against the micrograms of antigen loaded.
