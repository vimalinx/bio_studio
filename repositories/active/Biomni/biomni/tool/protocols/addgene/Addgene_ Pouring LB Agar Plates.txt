PROTOCOL: Pouring LB Agar Plates
SOURCE: https://www.addgene.org/protocols/pouring-lb-agar-plates/
================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Plasmids can carry one or more antibiotic resistance genes, which confer resistance
to a specific antibiotic to the bacteria carrying them. The presence of an
antibiotic resistance gene on a plasmid allows researchers to easily isolate
bacteria containing that plasmid from bacteria that do not contain it by
artificial selection (i.e. growing the bacteria in the presence of the antibiotic).

Luria broth (LB) is a nutrient-rich media commonly used to culture bacteria in
the lab. The addition of agar to LB results in the formation of a gel that
bacteria can grow on, as they are unable to digest the agar but can gather
nutrition from the LB within. The addition of an antibiotic to this gel allows
for the selection of only those bacteria with resistance to that antibiotic -
usually conferred by a plasmid carrying the antibiotic resistance gene. The
following protocol will allow you to make your own LB/agar plates with your
antibiotic of interest.

EQUIPMENT
================================================================================

• Autoclave
• Water bath
• Pipetman


REAGENTS
================================================================================

• 37 g pre-mixed powder consisting of:
  - 5.0 g yeast extract
  - 10.0 g peptone from casein
  - 10.0 g sodium chloride
  - 12.0 g agar-agar
• 1 L Sterile H₂O
• Sterile plates of your desired size - we usually use 60 mm x 15 mm plates which
  can hold 5-10 mL of agar and on which you can individually distinguish a maximum
  of ~100 colonies

  💡 PRO TIP: If you will be screening a large number of colonies, we recommend
  using larger plates. Many labs use 100 mm x 15 mm plates which can hold 10 - 15
  mL of agar.

• Autoclavable flasks
• Sterile pipettes
• Ice bucket to hold antibiotic
• Antibiotic at 1000 x concentration dissolved in the appropriate liquid solvent.
  See table below for appropriate antibiotic concentrations.

Antibiotic Concentrations:

Antibiotic      | Recommended Stock Concentration | Recommended Working Concentration
----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------
Ampicillin      | 100 mg/mL                      | 100 µg/mL
Bleocin          | 5 mg/mL                        | 5 µg/mL
Carbenicillin*  | 100 mg/mL                      | 100 µg/mL
Chloramphenicol | 25 mg/mL (dissolve in EtOH)    | 25 µg/mL
Coumermycin     | 25 mg/mL (dissolve in DMSO)    | 25 µg/mL
Gentamycin      | 10 mg/mL                       | 10 µg/mL
Kanamycin       | 50 mg/mL                       | 50 µg/mL
Spectinomycin   | 50 mg/mL                       | 50 µg/mL
Tetracycline    | 10 mg/mL                       | 10 µg/mL

Notes:
• Unless otherwise indicated, the antibiotic powder can be dissolved in dH₂O.
• *Carbenicillin can be used in place of ampicillin. Carbenicillin is more stable,
  so it is potentially more effective at selecting only bacteria containing the
  plasmids of interest (for example, fewer satellite colonies will grow). However,
  it is also more expensive.


PROCEDURE
================================================================================

1. Measure 37g of pre-mixed LB-agar powder per L of molten agar you'd like to
   make. The precise mass you measure out will be based on the number of plates
   you'd like to pour.

   For example:
   • Because we'd like to make 20 plates, and our plates can hold a maximum of
     10 mL, we'll want 200 mL of media total.
   • Importantly, we'll actually make a bit more than 200 mL (~220 mL) just in
     case we spill anything or have small errors in measurement. You should also
     always make a bit more gel-agar mix than you think you'll need.
   • So for 220 mL of LB-agar, we'll need: (37 g pre-mixed LB-agar powder/L) ×
     (0.220 L) = 8.14 g pre-mixed LB-agar powder.

2. Transfer the LB-agar powder you've measured out into an appropriately sized
   bottle for autoclaving. We make 400 mL of agar in 1 L bottles and 200 mL of
   agar in 500 mL bottles. The extra empty volume is necessary to prevent your
   molten agar from boiling over in the autoclave.

3. Transfer the sterile water (in our case 220 mL) to the same bottle and swirl to
   form a medium/agar colloid.

4. Cover the opening of the bottle with its cap or aluminum foil (but do not make
   an air-tight seal!) and tape the bottle with autoclave tape. The autoclave tape
   will darken during the autoclave process if your sample has spent at least 10
   min at 121 ℃. Use lab tape to label the bottle with your initials, the date,
   and the bottle contents. This will clear up any confusion later if you forget
   your bottle in the autoclave.

5. Place the gel mix in the autoclave and run on a setting that gets the sample to
   at least 121 ℃ under 20 psi for at least 30 min. The high pressure will prevent
   your gel mix from boiling over at high temperature.

   💡 PRO TIP: Although our recommended temperature should kill most potential
   contaminants, certain types of spores will stubbornly survive even under the
   harsh conditions in the autoclave. Be sure to check the literature for an
   appropriate sterilization technique if you are working with any weird and
   wonderful organisms.

6. While your samples are sterilizing in the autoclave, you should prepare your
   plate pouring station:
   • Find an empty section of lab bench with a working flame.
   • Spray down the bench with a 70% ethanol solution and wipe down with a paper
     towel.
   • Count out the appropriate number of plates and stack them on your lab bench.
   • Label the plates with the date and the medium they will contain including the
     identity of the antibiotic.

     💡 PRO TIP: We batch label our plates with colored marker - particular colors
     correspond to particular antibiotics.

   • Position the flame just to the side of where you'll be pouring your plates -
     be sure to leave room for your bottle of molten gel mix, a tube rack
     containing the appropriate antibiotics, and a section for active pouring.

7. Prepare your antibiotics. Prior to adding your antibiotic to the molten gel
   mix, you should create a 1000x stock solution.

   For example:
   • If you'll be preparing plates with a final concentration of 100 ug/mL
     ampicillin, you should make a stock solution of 100,000 ug/mL (100 mg/mL).
     Simply measure out 100 mg of ampicillin powder, add it to 1 mL of water,
     dissolve by vortexing, and filter sterilize.

8. Prepare a water bath at 60 ℃ with sufficient water to submerge ~75% of the
   bottle containing your molten gel mixture.

   💡 PRO TIP: You will cool the molten agar in the water bath prior to adding
   the antibiotic. 60 ℃ is a good temperature because the molten agar will remain
   liquid at this temperature but most antibiotics will not break down at this
   temperature. Check with your antibiotic's manufacturer to make sure this is
   true in your case.

9. Retrieve your molten agar mix from the autoclave.

   💡 PRO TIP: Once your autoclave cycle is complete, we recommend opening the door
   to the autoclave just a crack and leaving it open that way for ~10 min. This
   will allow any steam to escape from the autoclave and will cool your gel-mix
   slightly. Even so, you should always use thermally insulated gloves when
   removing anything from the autoclave.

10. Partially submerge your molten gel-mix in the 60 ℃ water bath.

    💡 PRO TIP: You should leave the molten gel-mix in the water bath for at least
    5 min. Do not let any of the water bath water touch the neck or top of the
    bottle as this water is not likely to be sterile. Cooled agar should be warm
    to the touch; as a rule of thumb, if you cannot take the molten agar out of the
    water bath wearing only lab gloves, it's not likely cool enough to add
    antibiotic to. To be certain your agar is at the right temperature, we
    recommend using a laser thermometer.

11. Light the flame at the plate pouring station and dilute your antibiotic into
    your ~60 ℃ molten gel mix using sterile technique.

12. Swirl the agar bottle to ensure even distribution of the antibiotic throughout
    the agar.

13. Open one plate at a time next to the flame and begin pouring. Measure your
    desired amount of agar with a pipette for the first plate to get a good idea
    of what that volume looks like in your particular plate.

14. For the remainder of the plates, pour directly from the bottle.

    💡 PRO TIPS:
    • Be sure to swirl your plates after pouring to remove bubbles and ensure an
      even distribution of agar over the bottom of the plate. Cap each plate after
      pouring and stack as you pour.
    • If your agar partially solidifies in the bottle while you're pouring, you
      should stop pouring and re-make the gel-mix. If you're making plates without
      any antibiotic you can alternatively re-liquefy the agar by running it
      through the autoclave again or by microwaving (if you microwave, beware of
      over-boiling!).

15. Leave your plates out on the bench to solidify.

    💡 PRO TIP: It takes roughly 30 min for our plates to solidify at room
    temperature, however we leave them out at room temperature overnight to allow
    them to dry. After overnight drying, we place the plates in a plastic bag with
    an absorbent material to reduce condensation. The plates are then stored at 4 ℃
    until use.

16. Once your plates have solidified and dried, you should test them to make sure
    the antibiotic functions properly:
    • Take out two plates.
    • On the first plate, streak out a strain that you know to be resistant to
      the antibiotic.
    • On the second plate, streak out a strain that's not resistant to the
      antibiotic.
    • Incubate both plates overnight at the appropriate growth temperature and
      check for growth. See our sample data section below for positive and negative
      test results.


SAMPLE DATA
================================================================================

In all cases below (-) indicates that the tested strain is not supposed to be
resistant to the antibiotic, (+) indicates that the tested strain is supposed to
be resistant to the antibiotic.

Positive Result: Only the Resistant Strain Grows

If everything was prepared properly, you should see growth of only the resistant
strain. If you get this final result, your plates are ready for use or storage at
4 ℃. You should not store your plates for longer than 1 month at any temperature
and should always check for contamination prior to use.

Negative Result 1: Both Strains Grow

Assuming the appropriate strains were streaked on the appropriate plates, then if
both strains grow, it's possible that:
• The antibiotic broke down.
• You forgot to add the antibiotic.
• You added the antibiotic at too low a concentration for selection.

Negative Result 2: Neither Strain Grows

If neither strain grows, it's possible that:
• You used the wrong antibiotic.
• Your antibiotic is at too high a concentration.
• One or both of your strains are no longer viable.

You can check for this possibility by streaking out both strains on plates without
any antibiotic.

Negative Result 3: Only the Non-resistant Strain Grows

If only the non-resistant strain grows, it's likely that you've used the wrong
antibiotic, or confused your strains.
